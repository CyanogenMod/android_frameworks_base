/**
 * Extended {@link ComponentCallbacks} interface with a new callback for
 * finer-grained memory management. This interface is available in all application components
 * ({@link android.app.Activity}, {@link android.app.Service},
 * {@link ContentProvider}, and {@link android.app.Application}).
 *
 * <p>You should implement {@link #onTrimMemory} to incrementally release memory based on current
 * system constraints. Using this callback to release your resources helps provide a more
 * responsive system overall, but also directly benefits the user experience for
 * your app by allowing the system to keep your process alive longer. That is,
 * if you <em>don't</em> trim your resources based on memory levels defined by this callback,
 * the system is more likely to kill your process while it is cached in the least-recently used
 * (LRU) list, thus requiring your app to restart and restore all state when the user returns to it.
 *
 * <p>The values provided by {@link #onTrimMemory} do not represent a single linear progression of
 * memory limits, but provide you different types of clues about memory availability:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When your app is running:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_MODERATE} <br>The device is beginning to run low on memory.
 * Your app is running and not killable.
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW} <br>The device is running much lower on memory.
 * Your app is running and not killable, but please release unused resources to improve system
 * performance (which directly impacts your app's performance).
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL} <br>The device is running extremely low on memory.
 * Your app is not yet considered a killable process, but the system will begin killing
 * background processes if apps do not release resources, so you should release non-critical
 * resources now to prevent performance degradation.
 *  </ol>
 * </li>
 * <li>When your app's visibility changes:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN} <br>Your app's UI is no longer visible, so this is a good
 * time to release large resources that are used only by your UI.
 *  </ol>
 * </li>
 * <li>When your app's process resides in the background LRU list:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND} <br>The system is running low on memory and your process is
 * near the beginning of the LRU list. Although your app process is not at a high risk of being
 * killed, the system may already be killing processes in the LRU list, so you should release
 * resources that are easy to recover so your process will remain in the list and resume
 * quickly when the user returns to your app.
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE} <br>The system is running low on memory and your process is
 * near the middle of the LRU list. If the system becomes further constrained for memory, there's a
 * chance your process will be killed.
 *  <li>{@link #TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE} <br>The system is running low on memory and your process is
 * one of the first to be killed if the system does not recover memory now. You should release
 * absolutely everything that's not critical to resuming your app state.
 *   <p>To support API levels lower than 14, you can use the {@link #onLowMemory} method as a
 * fallback that's roughly equivalent to the {@link ComponentCallbacks2#TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE} level.
 *  </li>
 *  </ol>
 * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When the system begins
 * killing processes in the LRU list, although it primarily works bottom-up, it does give some
 * consideration to which processes are consuming more memory and will thus provide more gains in
 * memory if killed. So the less memory you consume while in the LRU list overall, the better
 * your chances are to remain in the list and be able to quickly resume.</p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>More information about the different stages of a process lifecycle (such as what it means
 * to be placed in the background LRU list) is provided in the <a
 * href="{@docRoot}guide/components/processes-and-threads.html#Lifecycle">Processes and Threads</a>
 * document.
