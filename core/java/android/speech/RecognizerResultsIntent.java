/**
 * Constants for intents related to showing speech recognition results.
 *
 * These constants should not be needed for normal utilization of speech recognition. They
 * would only be called if you wanted to trigger a view of voice search results in your
 * application, or implemented if you wanted to offer a different view for voice search results
 * with your application.
 *
 * The standard behavior here for someone receiving an {@link #ACTION_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULTS} is to
 * first retrieve the list of {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS}, and use any provided
 * HTML for that result in {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML}, if available, to display
 * the search results. If that is not available, then the corresponding url for that result in
 * {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS} should be used. And if even that is not available,
 * then a search url should be constructed from the actual recognition result string.
