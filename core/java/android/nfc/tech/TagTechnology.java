/**
 * {@link TagTechnology} is an interface to a technology in a {@link Tag}.
 * <p>
 * Obtain a {@link TagTechnology} implementation by calling the static method <code>get()</code>
 * on the implementation class.
 * <p>
 * NFC tags are based on a number of independently developed technologies and offer a
 * wide range of capabilities. The
 * {@link TagTechnology} implementations provide access to these different
 * technologies and capabilities. Some sub-classes map to technology
 * specification (for example {@link NfcA}, {@link IsoDep}, others map to
 * pseudo-technologies or capabilities (for example {@link Ndef}, {@link NdefFormatable}).
 * <p>
 * It is mandatory for all Android NFC devices to provide the following
 * {@link TagTechnology} implementations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link NfcA} (also known as ISO 14443-3A)
 * <li>{@link NfcB} (also known as ISO 14443-3B)
 * <li>{@link NfcF} (also known as JIS 6319-4)
 * <li>{@link NfcV} (also known as ISO 15693)
 * <li>{@link IsoDep}
 * <li>{@link Ndef} on NFC Forum Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4 compliant tags
 * </ul>
 * It is optional for Android NFC devices to provide the following
 * {@link TagTechnology} implementations. If it is not provided, the
 * Android device will never enumerate that class via {@link Tag#getTechList}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link MifareClassic}
 * <li>{@link MifareUltralight}
 * <li>{@link NdefFormatable} must only be enumerated on tags for which this Android device
 * is capable of formatting. Proprietary knowledge is often required to format a tag
 * to make it NDEF compatible.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link TagTechnology} implementations provide methods that fall into two classes:
 * <em>cached getters</em> and <em>I/O operations</em>.
 * <h4>Cached getters</h4>
 * These methods (usually prefixed by <code>get</code> or <code>is</code>) return
 * properties of the tag, as determined at discovery time. These methods will never
 * block or cause RF activity, and do not require {@link #connect} to have been called.
 * They also never update, for example if a property is changed by an I/O operation with a tag
 * then the cached getter will still return the result from tag discovery time.
 * <h4>I/O operations</h4>
 * I/O operations may require RF activity, and may block. They have the following semantics.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #connect} must be called before using any other I/O operation.
 * <li>{@link #close} must be called after completing I/O operations with a
 * {@link TagTechnology}, and it will cancel all other blocked I/O operations on other threads
 * (including {@link #connect} with {@link IOException}.
 * <li>Only one {@link TagTechnology} can be connected at a time. Other calls to
 * {@link #connect} will return {@link IOException}.
 * <li>I/O operations may block, and should never be called on the main application
 * thread.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Methods that perform I/O operations
 * require the {@link android.Manifest.permission#NFC} permission.
