/**
 * This interface supplies all UI-specific behavior of the window manager.  An
 * instance of it is created by the window manager when it starts up, and allows
 * customization of window layering, special window types, key dispatching, and
 * layout.
 * 
 * <p>Because this provides deep interaction with the system window manager,
 * specific methods on this interface can be called from a variety of contexts
 * with various restrictions on what they can do.  These are encoded through
 * a suffixes at the end of a method encoding the thread the method is called
 * from and any locks that are held when it is being called; if no suffix
 * is attached to a method, then it is not called with any locks and may be
 * called from the main window manager thread or another thread calling into
 * the window manager.
 * 
 * <p>The current suffixes are:
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt> Ti <dd> Called from the input thread.  This is the thread that
 * collects pending input events and dispatches them to the appropriate window.
 * It may block waiting for events to be processed, so that the input stream is
 * properly serialized.
 * <dt> Tq <dd> Called from the low-level input queue thread.  This is the
 * thread that reads events out of the raw input devices and places them
 * into the global input queue that is read by the <var>Ti</var> thread.
 * This thread should not block for a long period of time on anything but the
 * key driver.
 * <dt> Lw <dd> Called with the main window manager lock held.  Because the
 * window manager is a very low-level system service, there are few other
 * system services you can call with this lock held.  It is explicitly okay to
 * make calls into the package manager and power manager; it is explicitly not
 * okay to make calls into the activity manager or most other services.  Note that
 * {@link android.content.Context#checkPermission(String, int, int)} and
 * variations require calling into the activity manager.
 * <dt> Li <dd> Called with the input thread lock held.  This lock can be
 * acquired by the window manager while it holds the window lock, so this is
 * even more restrictive than <var>Lw</var>.
 * </dl>
