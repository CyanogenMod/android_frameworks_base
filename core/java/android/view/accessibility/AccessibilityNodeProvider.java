/**
 * This class is the contract a client should implement to enable support of a
 * virtual view hierarchy rooted at a given view for accessibility purposes. A virtual
 * view hierarchy is a tree of imaginary Views that is reported as a part of the view
 * hierarchy when an {@link AccessibilityService} explores the window content.
 * Since the virtual View tree does not exist this class is responsible for
 * managing the {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo}s describing that tree to accessibility
 * services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main use case of these APIs is to enable a custom view that draws complex content,
 * for example a monthly calendar grid, to be presented as a tree of logical nodes,
 * for example month days each containing events, thus conveying its logical structure.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A typical use case is to override {@link View#getAccessibilityNodeProvider()} of the
 * View that is a root of a virtual View hierarchy to return an instance of this class.
 * In such a case this instance is responsible for managing {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo}s
 * describing the virtual sub-tree rooted at the View including the one representing the
 * View itself. Similarly the returned instance is responsible for performing accessibility
 * actions on any virtual view or the root view itself. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *     getAccessibilityNodeProvider(
 *         if (mAccessibilityNodeProvider == null) {
 *             mAccessibilityNodeProvider = new AccessibilityNodeProvider() {
 *                 public boolean performAction(int action, int virtualDescendantId) {
 *                     // Implementation.
 *                     return false;
 *                 }
 *
 *                 public List<AccessibilityNodeInfo> findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText(String text,
 *                         int virtualDescendantId) {
 *                     // Implementation.
 *                     return null;
 *                 }
 *
 *                 public AccessibilityNodeInfo createAccessibilityNodeInfo(int virtualDescendantId) {
 *                     // Implementation.
 *                     return null;
 *                 }
 *             });
 *     return mAccessibilityNodeProvider;
 * </pre>
