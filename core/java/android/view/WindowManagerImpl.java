/**
 * Provides low-level communication with the system window manager for
 * operations that are bound to a particular context, display or parent window.
 * Instances of this object are sensitive to the compatibility info associated
 * with the running application.
 *
 * This object implements the {@link ViewManager} interface,
 * allowing you to add any View subclass as a top-level window on the screen.
 * Additional window manager specific layout parameters are defined for
 * control over how windows are displayed.  It also implements the {@link WindowManager}
 * interface, allowing you to control the displays attached to the device.
 *
 * <p>Applications will not normally use WindowManager directly, instead relying
 * on the higher-level facilities in {@link android.app.Activity} and
 * {@link android.app.Dialog}.
 *
 * <p>Even for low-level window manager access, it is almost never correct to use
 * this class.  For example, {@link android.app.Activity#getWindowManager}
 * provides a window manager for adding windows that are associated with that
 * activity -- the window manager will not normally allow you to add arbitrary
 * windows that are not associated with an activity.
