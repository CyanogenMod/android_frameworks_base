/**
 * Object used to report movement (mouse, pen, finger, trackball) events.  This
 * class may hold either absolute or relative movements, depending on what
 * it is being used for.
 * <p>
 * On pointing devices such as touch screens, pointer coordinates specify absolute
 * positions such as view X/Y coordinates.  Each complete gesture is represented
 * by a sequence of motion events with actions that describe pointer state transitions
 * and movements.  A gesture starts with a motion event with {@link #ACTION_DOWN}
 * that provides the location of the first pointer down.  As each additional
 * pointer that goes down or up, the framework will generate a motion event with
 * {@link #ACTION_POINTER_DOWN} or {@link #ACTION_POINTER_UP} accordingly.
 * Pointer movements are described by motion events with {@link #ACTION_MOVE}.
 * Finally, a gesture end either when the final pointer goes up as represented
 * by a motion event with {@link #ACTION_UP} or when gesture is canceled
 * with {@link #ACTION_CANCEL}.
 * </p><p>
 * On trackballs, the pointer coordinates specify relative movements as X/Y deltas.
 * A trackball gesture consists of a sequence of movements described by motion
 * events with {@link #ACTION_MOVE} interspersed with occasional {@link #ACTION_DOWN}
 * or {@link #ACTION_UP} motion events when the trackball button is pressed or released.
 * </p><p>
 * Motion events always report movements for all pointers at once.  The number
 * of pointers only ever changes by one as individual pointers go up and down,
 * except when the gesture is canceled.
 * </p><p>
 * The order in which individual pointers appear within a motion event can change
 * from one event to the next. Use the {@link #getPointerId(int)} method to obtain a
 * pointer id to track pointers across motion events in a gesture.  Then for
 * successive motion events, use the {@link #findPointerIndex(int)} method to obtain
 * the pointer index for a given pointer id in that motion event.
 * </p><p>
 * For efficiency, motion events with {@link #ACTION_MOVE} may batch together
 * multiple movement samples within a single object.  The most current
 * pointer coordinates are available using {@link #getX(int)} and {@link #getY(int)}.
 * Earlier coordinates within the batch are accessed using {@link #getHistoricalX(int, int)}
 * and {@link #getHistoricalY(int, int)}.  The coordinates are "historical" only
 * insofar as they are older than the current coordinates in the batch; however,
 * they are still distinct from any other coordinates reported in prior motion events.
 * To process all coordinates in the batch in time order, first consume the historical
 * coordinates then consume the current coordinates.
 * </p><p>
 * Example: Consuming all samples for all pointers in a motion event in time order.
 * </p><p><pre><code>
 * void printSamples(MotionEvent ev) {
 *     final int historySize = ev.getHistorySize();
 *     final int pointerCount = ev.getPointerCount();
 *     for (int h = 0; h &lt; historySize; h++) {
 *         System.out.printf("At time %d:", ev.getHistoricalEventTime(h));
 *         for (int p = 0; p &lt; pointerCount; p++) {
 *             System.out.printf("  pointer %d: (%f,%f)",
 *                 ev.getPointerId(p), ev.getHistoricalX(p, h), ev.getHistoricalY(p, h));
 *         }
 *     }
 *     System.out.printf("At time %d:", ev.getEventTime());
 *     for (int p = 0; p &lt; pointerCount; p++) {
 *         System.out.printf("  pointer %d: (%f,%f)",
 *             ev.getPointerId(p), ev.getX(p), ev.getY(p));
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre></p><p>
 * In general, the framework cannot guarantee that the motion events it delivers
 * to a view always constitute a complete motion sequences since some events may be dropped
 * or modified by containing views before they are delivered.  The view implementation
 * should be prepared to handle {@link #ACTION_CANCEL} and should tolerate anomalous
 * situations such as receiving a new {@link #ACTION_DOWN} without first having
 * received an {@link #ACTION_UP} for the prior gesture.
 * </p><p>
 * Refer to {@link InputDevice} for more information about how different kinds of
 * input devices and sources represent pointer coordinates.
