/**
 * The InputConnection interface is the communication channel from an

 * input. It is used to perform such things as reading text around the
 * cursor, committing text to the text box, and sending raw key events
 * to the application.
 *
 * <p>Starting from API Level {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N},
 * the system can deal with the situation where the application directly
 * implements this class but one or more of the following methods are
 * not implemented.</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #getSelectedText(int)}, which was introduced in
 *     {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#GINGERBREAD}.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #setComposingRegion(int, int)}, which was introduced

 *
 * <h3>Implementing an IME or an editor</h3>
 * <p>Text input is the result of the synergy of two essential components:
 * an Input Method Engine (IME) and an editor. The IME can be a
 * software keyboard, a handwriting interface, an emoji palette, a
 * speech-to-text engine, and so on. There are typically several IMEs
 * installed on any given Android device. In Android, IMEs extend
 * {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService}.
 * For more information about how to create an IME, see the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/text/creating-input-method.html">
 * Creating an input method</a> guide.
 *
 * The editor is the component that receives text and displays it.
 * Typically, this is an {@link android.widget.EditText} instance, but
 * some applications may choose to implement their own editor for
 * various reasons. This is a large and complicated task, and an
 * application that does this needs to make sure the behavior is
 * consistent with standard EditText behavior in Android. An editor
 * needs to interact with the IME, receiving commands through
 * this InputConnection interface, and sending commands through
 * {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager}. An editor
 * should start by implementing
 * {@link android.view.View#onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)}
 * to return its own input connection.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are implementing your own IME, you will need to call the
 * methods in this interface to interact with the application. Be sure
 * to test your IME with a wide range of applications, including
 * browsers and rich text editors, as some may have peculiarities you
 * need to deal with. Remember your IME may not be the only source of
 * changes on the text, and try to be as conservative as possible in
 * the data you send and as liberal as possible in the data you
 * receive.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are implementing your own editor, you will probably need
 * to provide your own subclass of {@link BaseInputConnection} to
 * answer to the commands from IMEs. Please be sure to test your
 * editor with as many IMEs as you can as their behavior can vary a
 * lot. Also be sure to test with various languages, including CJK
 * languages and right-to-left languages like Arabic, as these may
 * have different input requirements. When in doubt about the
 * behavior you should adopt for a particular call, please mimic the
 * default TextView implementation in the latest Android version, and
 * if you decide to drift from it, please consider carefully that
 * inconsistencies in text editor behavior is almost universally felt
 * as a bad thing by users.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Cursors, selections and compositions</h3>
 * <p>In Android, the cursor and the selection are one and the same
 * thing. A "cursor" is just the special case of a zero-sized
 * selection. As such, this documentation uses them
 * interchangeably. Any method acting "before the cursor" would act
 * before the start of the selection if there is one, and any method
 * acting "after the cursor" would act after the end of the
 * selection.</p>
 *
 * <p>An editor needs to be able to keep track of a currently
 * "composing" region, like the standard edition widgets do. The
 * composition is marked in a specific style: see
 * {@link android.text.Spanned#SPAN_COMPOSING}. IMEs use this to help
 * the user keep track of what part of the text they are currently
 * focusing on, and interact with the editor using
 * {@link InputConnection#setComposingText(CharSequence, int)},
 * {@link InputConnection#setComposingRegion(int, int)} and
 * {@link InputConnection#finishComposingText()}.
 * The composing region and the selection are completely independent
 * of each other, and the IME may use them however they see fit.</p>
