/**
 * This class gives you control of the power state of the device.  
 * 
 * <p><b>Device battery life will be significantly affected by the use of this API.</b>  Do not
 * acquire WakeLocks unless you really need them, use the minimum levels possible, and be sure
 * to release it as soon as you can.
 * 
 * <p>You can obtain an instance of this class by calling 
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(java.lang.String) Context.getSystemService()}.
 * 
 * <p>The primary API you'll use is {@link #newWakeLock(int, String) newWakeLock()}.  This will
 * create a {@link PowerManager.WakeLock} object.  You can then use methods on this object to 
 * control the power state of the device.  In practice it's quite simple:
 * 
 * {@samplecode
 * PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
 * PowerManager.WakeLock wl = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK, "My Tag");
 * wl.acquire();
 *   ..screen will stay on during this section..
 * wl.release();
 * }
 * 
 * <p>The following flags are defined, with varying effects on system power.  <i>These flags are
 * mutually exclusive - you may only specify one of them.</i>
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">
 *
 *     <thead>
 *     <tr><th>Flag Value</th> 
 *     <th>CPU</th> <th>Screen</th> <th>Keyboard</th></tr>
 *     </thead>
 *
 *     <tbody>
 *     <tr><th>{@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK}</th>
 *         <td>On*</td> <td>Off</td> <td>Off</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK}</th>
 *         <td>On</td> <td>Dim</td> <td>Off</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *
 *     <tr><th>{@link #SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK}</th>
 *         <td>On</td> <td>Bright</td> <td>Off</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #FULL_WAKE_LOCK}</th>
 *         <td>On</td> <td>Bright</td> <td>Bright</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *     </tbody>
 * </table>
 * 
 * <p>*<i>If you hold a partial wakelock, the CPU will continue to run, irrespective of any timers 
 * and even after the user presses the power button.  In all other wakelocks, the CPU will run, but
 * the user can still put the device to sleep using the power button.</i>
 * 
 * <p>In addition, you can add two more flags, which affect behavior of the screen only.  <i>These
 * flags have no effect when combined with a {@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK}.</i>
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">
 *

 *     <tr><th>Flag Value</th> <th>Description</th></tr>

 *     <tr><th>{@link #ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP}</th>
 *         <td>Normal wake locks don't actually turn on the illumination.  Instead, they cause
 *         the illumination to remain on once it turns on (e.g. from user activity).  This flag
 *         will force the screen and/or keyboard to turn on immediately, when the WakeLock is
 *         acquired.  A typical use would be for notifications which are important for the user to
 *         see immediately.</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *     
 *     <tr><th>{@link #ON_AFTER_RELEASE}</th>
 *         <td>If this flag is set, the user activity timer will be reset when the WakeLock is

 *         reduce flicker if you are cycling between wake lock conditions.</td> 
 *     </tr>
 *     </tbody>
