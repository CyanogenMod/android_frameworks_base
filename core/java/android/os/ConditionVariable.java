 * in that this class contains the condition to wait on itself.  That means
 * open(), close() and block() are sticky.  If open() is called before block(),
 * block() will not block, and instead return immediately.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class uses itself as the object to wait on, so if you wait()
 * or notify() on a ConditionVariable, the results are undefined.
