     * Traditionally this is an SD card, but it may also be implemented as
     * built-in storage in a device that is distinct from the protected
     * internal storage and can be mounted as a filesystem on a computer.</em></p>

     * <p>On devices with multiple users (as described by {@link UserManager}),
     * each user has their own isolated external storage. Applications only
     * have access to the external storage for the user they're running as.</p>
     *
     * <p>In devices with multiple "external" storage directories (such as
     * both secure app storage and mountable shared storage), this directory
     * represents the "primary" external storage that the user will interact
     * with.</p>
     *
     * <p>Applications should not directly use this top-level directory, in
     * order to avoid polluting the user's root namespace.  Any files that are
     * private to the application should be placed in a directory returned
     * by {@link android.content.Context#getExternalFilesDir
     * Context.getExternalFilesDir}, which the system will take care of deleting
     * if the application is uninstalled.  Other shared files should be placed
     * in one of the directories returned by
     * {@link #getExternalStoragePublicDirectory}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Writing to this path requires the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission. In
     * a future platform release, access to this path will require the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission,
     * which is automatically granted if you hold the write permission.</p>
     *
     * <p>This path may change between platform versions, so applications
