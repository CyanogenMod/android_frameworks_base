/**
 * Core timekeeping facilities.
 *
 * <p> Three different clocks are available, and they should not be confused:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <p> {@link System#currentTimeMillis System.currentTimeMillis()}
 *     is the standard "wall" clock (time and date) expressing milliseconds
 *     since the epoch.  The wall clock can be set by the user or the phone
 *     network (see {@link #setCurrentTimeMillis}), so the time may jump
 *     backwards or forwards unpredictably.  This clock should only be used
 *     when correspondence with real-world dates and times is important, such
 *     as in a calendar or alarm clock application.  Interval or elapsed
 *     time measurements should use a different clock.  If you are using
 *     System.currentTimeMillis(), consider listening to the
 *     {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIME_TICK ACTION_TIME_TICK},
 *     {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIME_CHANGED ACTION_TIME_CHANGED}
 *     and {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED
 *     ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED} {@link android.content.Intent Intent}
 *     broadcasts to find out when the time changes.
 *
 *     <li> <p> {@link #uptimeMillis} is counted in milliseconds since the
 *     system was booted.  This clock stops when the system enters deep
 *     sleep (CPU off, display dark, device waiting for external input),
 *     but is not affected by clock scaling, idle, or other power saving
 *     mechanisms.  This is the basis for most interval timing
 *     such as {@link Thread#sleep(long) Thread.sleep(millls)},
 *     {@link Object#wait(long) Object.wait(millis)}, and
 *     {@link System#nanoTime System.nanoTime()}.  This clock is guaranteed
 *     to be monotonic, and is suitable for interval timing when the
 *     interval does not span device sleep.  Most methods that accept a
 *     timestamp value currently expect the {@link #uptimeMillis} clock.
 *
 *     <li> <p> {@link #elapsedRealtime} and {@link #elapsedRealtimeNanos}
 *     return the time since the system was booted, and include deep sleep.
 *     This clock is guaranteed to be monotonic, and continues to tick even
 *     when the CPU is in power saving modes, so is the recommend basis
 *     for general purpose interval timing.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are several mechanisms for controlling the timing of events:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <p> Standard functions like {@link Thread#sleep(long)
 *     Thread.sleep(millis)} and {@link Object#wait(long) Object.wait(millis)}
 *     are always available.  These functions use the {@link #uptimeMillis}
 *     clock; if the device enters sleep, the remainder of the time will be
 *     postponed until the device wakes up.  These synchronous functions may
 *     be interrupted with {@link Thread#interrupt Thread.interrupt()}, and
 *     you must handle {@link InterruptedException}.
 *
 *     <li> <p> {@link #sleep SystemClock.sleep(millis)} is a utility function
 *     very similar to {@link Thread#sleep(long) Thread.sleep(millis)}, but it
 *     ignores {@link InterruptedException}.  Use this function for delays if
 *     you do not use {@link Thread#interrupt Thread.interrupt()}, as it will
 *     preserve the interrupted state of the thread.
 *
 *     <li> <p> The {@link android.os.Handler} class can schedule asynchronous
 *     callbacks at an absolute or relative time.  Handler objects also use the
 *     {@link #uptimeMillis} clock, and require an {@link android.os.Looper
 *     event loop} (normally present in any GUI application).
 *
 *     <li> <p> The {@link android.app.AlarmManager} can trigger one-time or
 *     recurring events which occur even when the device is in deep sleep
 *     or your application is not running.  Events may be scheduled with your
 *     choice of {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis} (RTC) or
 *     {@link #elapsedRealtime} (ELAPSED_REALTIME), and cause an
 *     {@link android.content.Intent} broadcast when they occur.
 * </ul>
