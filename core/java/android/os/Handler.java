/**
 * A Handler allows you to send and process {@link Message} and Runnable
 * objects associated with a thread's {@link MessageQueue}.  Each Handler
 * instance is associated with a single thread and that thread's message
 * queue.  When you create a new Handler, it is bound to the thread /
 * message queue of the thread that is creating it -- from that point on,
 * it will deliver messages and runnables to that message queue and execute
 * them as they come out of the message queue.
 *
 * <p>There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and
 * runnables to be executed as some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue
 * an action to be performed on a different thread than your own.
 *
 * <p>Scheduling messages is accomplished with the
 * {@link #post}, {@link #postAtTime(Runnable, long)},
 * {@link #postDelayed}, {@link #sendEmptyMessage},
 * {@link #sendMessage}, {@link #sendMessageAtTime}, and
 * {@link #sendMessageDelayed} methods.  The <em>post</em> versions allow
 * you to enqueue Runnable objects to be called by the message queue when
 * they are received; the <em>sendMessage</em> versions allow you to enqueue
 * a {@link Message} object containing a bundle of data that will be
 * processed by the Handler's {@link #handleMessage} method (requiring that
 * you implement a subclass of Handler).
 *
 * <p>When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either
 * allow the item to be processed as soon as the message queue is ready
 * to do so, or specify a delay before it gets processed or absolute time for
 * it to be processed.  The latter two allow you to implement timeouts,
 * ticks, and other timing-based behavior.
 *
 * <p>When a
 * process is created for your application, its main thread is dedicated to
 * running a message queue that takes care of managing the top-level
 * application objects (activities, broadcast receivers, etc) and any windows
 * they create.  You can create your own threads, and communicate back with
 * the main application thread through a Handler.  This is done by calling
 * the same <em>post</em> or <em>sendMessage</em> methods as before, but from
 * your new thread.  The given Runnable or Message will then be scheduled
 * in the Handler's message queue and processed when appropriate.
