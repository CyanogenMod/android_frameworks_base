/**
 * Base interface for a remotable object, the core part of a lightweight
 * remote procedure call mechanism designed for high performance when
 * performing in-process and cross-process calls.  This
 * interface describes the abstract protocol for interacting with a
 * remotable object.  Do not implement this interface directly, instead
 * extend from {@link Binder}.
 *
 * <p>The key IBinder API is {@link #transact transact()} matched by
 * {@link Binder#onTransact Binder.onTransact()}.  These
 * methods allow you to send a call to an IBinder object and receive a
 * call coming in to a Binder object, respectively.  This transaction API
 * is synchronous, such that a call to {@link #transact transact()} does not
 * return until the target has returned from
 * {@link Binder#onTransact Binder.onTransact()}; this is the
 * expected behavior when calling an object that exists in the local
 * process, and the underlying inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism
 * ensures that these same semantics apply when going across processes.
 *
 * <p>The data sent through transact() is a {@link Parcel}, a generic buffer
 * of data that also maintains some meta-data about its contents.  The meta
 * data is used to manage IBinder object references in the buffer, so that those
 * references can be maintained as the buffer moves across processes.  This
 * mechanism ensures that when an IBinder is written into a Parcel and sent to
 * another process, if that other process sends a reference to that same IBinder
 * back to the original process, then the original process will receive the
 * same IBinder object back.  These semantics allow IBinder/Binder objects to
 * be used as a unique identity (to serve as a token or for other purposes)
 * that can be managed across processes.
 *
 * <p>The system maintains a pool of transaction threads in each process that
 * it runs in.  These threads are used to dispatch all
 * IPCs coming in from other processes.  For example, when an IPC is made from
 * process A to process B, the calling thread in A blocks in transact() as
 * it sends the transaction to process B.  The next available pool thread in
 * B receives the incoming transaction, calls Binder.onTransact() on the target
 * object, and replies with the result Parcel.  Upon receiving its result, the
 * thread in process A returns to allow its execution to continue.  In effect,
 * other processes appear to use as additional threads that you did not create
 * executing in your own process.
 *
 * <p>The Binder system also supports recursion across processes.  For example
 * if process A performs a transaction to process B, and process B while
 * handling that transaction calls transact() on an IBinder that is implemented
 * in A, then the thread in A that is currently waiting for the original
 * transaction to finish will take care of calling Binder.onTransact() on the
 * object being called by B.  This ensures that the recursion semantics when
 * calling remote binder object are the same as when calling local objects.
 *
 * <p>When working with remote objects, you often want to find out when they
 * are no longer valid.  There are three ways this can be determined:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The {@link #transact transact()} method will throw a
 * {@link RemoteException} exception if you try to call it on an IBinder
 * whose process no longer exists.
 * <li> The {@link #pingBinder()} method can be called, and will return false
 * if the remote process no longer exists.
 * <li> The {@link #linkToDeath linkToDeath()} method can be used to register
 * a {@link DeathRecipient} with the IBinder, which will be called when its
 * containing process goes away.
 * </ul>
