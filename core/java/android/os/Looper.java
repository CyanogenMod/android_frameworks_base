/**
  * Class used to run a message loop for a thread.  Threads by default do
  * not have a message loop associated with them; to create one, call
  * {@link #prepare} in the thread that is to run the loop, and then
  * {@link #loop} to have it process messages until the loop is stopped.
  *
  * <p>Most interaction with a message loop is through the
  * {@link Handler} class.
  *
  * <p>This is a typical example of the implementation of a Looper thread,
  * using the separation of {@link #prepare} and {@link #loop} to create an
  * initial Handler to communicate with the Looper.
  *
  * <pre>
  *  class LooperThread extends Thread {
  *      public Handler mHandler;
  *
  *      public void run() {
  *          Looper.prepare();
  *
  *          mHandler = new Handler() {
  *              public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
  *                  // process incoming messages here
  *              }
