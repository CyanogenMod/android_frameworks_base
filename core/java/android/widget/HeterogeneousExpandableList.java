 * Additional methods that when implemented make an

 * <p>
 * An {@link ExpandableListAdapter} declares it has one view type for its group items
 * and one view type for its child items. Although adapted for most {@link ExpandableListView}s,
 * these values should be tuned for heterogeneous {@link ExpandableListView}s.
 * </p>
 * Lists that contain different types of group and/or child item views, should use an adapter that
 * implements this interface. This way, the recycled views that will be provided to
 * {@link android.widget.ExpandableListAdapter#getGroupView(int, boolean, View, ViewGroup)}
 * and
 * {@link android.widget.ExpandableListAdapter#getChildView(int, int, boolean, View, ViewGroup)}
 * will be of the appropriate group or child type, resulting in a more efficient reuse of the
 * previously created views.
