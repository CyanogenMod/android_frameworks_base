/**
 * An easy adapter to map static data to group and child views defined in an XML
 * file. You can separately specify the data backing the group as a List of
 * Maps. Each entry in the ArrayList corresponds to one group in the expandable
 * list. The Maps contain the data for each row. You also specify an XML file
 * that defines the views used to display a group, and a mapping from keys in
 * the Map to specific views. This process is similar for a child, except it is
 * one-level deeper so the data backing is specified as a List<List<Map>>,
 * where the first List corresponds to the group of the child, the second List
 * corresponds to the position of the child within the group, and finally the
 * Map holds the data for that particular child.
