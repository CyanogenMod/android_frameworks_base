 * you want to display the columns, and the XML file that defines the appearance
 * of these views. Separate XML files for child and groups are possible.
 *
 * Binding occurs in two phases. First, if a
 * {@link android.widget.SimpleCursorTreeAdapter.ViewBinder} is available,
 * {@link ViewBinder#setViewValue(android.view.View, android.database.Cursor, int)}
 * is invoked. If the returned value is true, binding has occurred. If the
 * returned value is false and the view to bind is a TextView,
 * {@link #setViewText(TextView, String)} is invoked. If the returned value
 * is false and the view to bind is an ImageView,
 * {@link #setViewImage(ImageView, String)} is invoked. If no appropriate
 * binding can be found, an {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown.
