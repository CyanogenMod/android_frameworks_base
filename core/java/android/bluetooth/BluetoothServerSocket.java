/**
 * A listening Bluetooth socket.
 *
 * <p>The interface for Bluetooth Sockets is similar to that of TCP sockets:
 * {@link java.net.Socket} and {@link java.net.ServerSocket}. On the server
 * side, use a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} to create a listening server
 * socket. When a connection is accepted by the {@link BluetoothServerSocket},
 * it will return a new {@link BluetoothSocket} to manage the connection.
 * On the client side, use a single {@link BluetoothSocket} to both initiate
 * an outgoing connection and to manage the connection.
 *
 * <p>The most common type of Bluetooth socket is RFCOMM, which is the type
 * supported by the Android APIs. RFCOMM is a connection-oriented, streaming
 * transport over Bluetooth. It is also known as the Serial Port Profile (SPP).
 *
 * <p>To create a listening {@link BluetoothServerSocket} that's ready for
 * incoming connections, use
 * {@link BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord
 * BluetoothAdapter.listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord()}. Then call
 * {@link #accept()} to listen for incoming connection requests. This call
 * will block until a connection is established, at which point, it will return
 * a {@link BluetoothSocket} to manage the connection. Once the {@link
 * BluetoothSocket} is acquired, it's a good idea to call {@link #close()} on
 * the {@link BluetoothServerSocket} when it's no longer needed for accepting
 * connections. Closing the {@link BluetoothServerSocket} will <em>not</em>
 * close the returned {@link BluetoothSocket}.
 *
 * <p>{@link BluetoothServerSocket} is thread
 * safe. In particular, {@link #close} will always immediately abort ongoing
 * operations and close the server socket.
 *
 * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
 * Requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH} permission.
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about using Bluetooth, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/wireless/bluetooth.html">Bluetooth</a> developer guide.</p>
