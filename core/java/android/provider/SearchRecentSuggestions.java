/**
 * This is a utility class providing access to

 *
 * <p>Unlike some utility classes, this one must be instantiated and properly initialized, so that
 * it can be configured to operate with the search suggestions provider that you have created.
 *
 * <p>Typically, you will do this in your searchable activity, each time you receive an incoming
 * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} Intent.  The code to record each
 * incoming query is as follows:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *      SearchSuggestions suggestions = new SearchSuggestions(this,
 *              MySuggestionsProvider.AUTHORITY, MySuggestionsProvider.MODE);
 *      suggestions.saveRecentQuery(queryString, null);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For a working example, see SearchSuggestionSampleProvider and SearchQueryResults in
 * samples/ApiDemos/app.
