/**
 * A description of an Intent and target action to perform with it.  Instances
 * of this class are created with {@link #getActivity}, {@link #getActivities},
 * {@link #getBroadcast}, and {@link #getService}; the returned object can be
 * handed to other applications so that they can perform the action you
 * described on your behalf at a later time.
 *
 * <p>By giving a PendingIntent to another application,
 * you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified
 * as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and
 * identity).  As such, you should be careful about how you build the PendingIntent:
 * almost always, for example, the base Intent you supply should have the component
 * name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately
 * sent there and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>A PendingIntent itself is simply a reference to a token maintained by
 * the system describing the original data used to retrieve it.  This means
 * that, even if its owning application's process is killed, the
 * PendingIntent itself will remain usable from other processes that
 * have been given it.  If the creating application later re-retrieves the
 * same kind of PendingIntent (same operation, same Intent action, data,
 * categories, and components, and same flags), it will receive a PendingIntent
 * representing the same token if that is still valid, and can thus call
 * {@link #cancel} to remove it.
 *
 * <p>Because of this behavior, it is important to know when two Intents
 * are considered to be the same for purposes of retrieving a PendingIntent.
 * A common mistake people make is to create multiple PendingIntent objects
 * with Intents that only vary in their "extra" contents, expecting to get
 * a different PendingIntent each time.  This does <em>not</em> happen.  The
 * parts of the Intent that are used for matching are the same ones defined
 * by {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}.  If you use two
 * Intent objects that are equivalent as per
 * {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}, then you will get
 * the same PendingIntent for both of them.
 *
 * <p>There are two typical ways to deal with this.
 *
 * <p>If you truly need multiple distinct PendingIntent objects active at
 * the same time (such as to use as two notifications that are both shown
 * at the same time), then you will need to ensure there is something that
 * is different about them to associate them with different PendingIntents.
 * This may be any of the Intent attributes considered by
 * {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}, or different
 * request code integers supplied to {@link #getActivity}, {@link #getActivities},
 * {@link #getBroadcast}, or {@link #getService}.
 *
 * <p>If you only need one PendingIntent active at a time for any of the
 * Intents you will use, then you can alternatively use the flags
 * {@link #FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT} or {@link #FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT} to either
 * cancel or modify whatever current PendingIntent is associated with the
 * Intent you are supplying.
