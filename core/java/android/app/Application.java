 * AndroidManifest.xml's &lt;application&gt; tag, which will cause that class
 * to be instantiated for you when the process for your application/package is
 * created.
 *
 * <p class="note">There is normally no need to subclass Application.  In
 * most situation, static singletons can provide the same functionality in a
 * more modular way.  If your singleton needs a global context (for example
 * to register broadcast receivers), the function to retrieve it can be
 * given a {@link android.content.Context} which internally uses
 * {@link android.content.Context#getApplicationContext() Context.getApplicationContext()}
 * when first constructing the singleton.</p>
