/**
 * This class provides access to the system alarm services.  These allow you
 * to schedule your application to be run at some point in the future.  When
 * an alarm goes off, the {@link Intent} that had been registered for it
 * is broadcast by the system, automatically starting the target application
 * if it is not already running.  Registered alarms are retained while the
 * device is asleep (and can optionally wake the device up if they go off
 * during that time), but will be cleared if it is turned off and rebooted.
 *
 * <p>The Alarm Manager holds a CPU wake lock as long as the alarm receiver's
 * onReceive() method is executing. This guarantees that the phone will not sleep
 * until you have finished handling the broadcast. Once onReceive() returns, the
 * Alarm Manager releases this wake lock. This means that the phone will in some
 * cases sleep as soon as your onReceive() method completes.  If your alarm receiver
 * called {@link android.content.Context#startService Context.startService()}, it
 * is possible that the phone will sleep before the requested service is launched.
 * To prevent this, your BroadcastReceiver and Service will need to implement a
 * separate wake lock policy to ensure that the phone continues running until the
 * service becomes available.
 *
 * <p><b>Note: The Alarm Manager is intended for cases where you want to have
 * your application code run at a specific time, even if your application is
 * not currently running.  For normal timing operations (ticks, timeouts,
 * etc) it is easier and much more efficient to use
 * {@link android.os.Handler}.</b>
 *
 * <p>You do not
 * instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService
 * Context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE)}.
