/**
 * Base class for implementing a device administration component.  This
 * class provides a convenience for interpreting the raw intent actions
 * that are sent by the system.
 *
 * <p>The callback methods, like the base
 * {@link BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(Context, Intent) BroadcastReceiver.onReceive()}
 * method, happen on the main thread of the process.  Thus long running
 * operations must be done on another thread.  Note that because a receiver
 * is done once returning from its receive function, such long-running operations
 * should probably be done in a {@link Service}.
 *
 * <p>When publishing your DeviceAdmin subclass as a receiver, it must
 * handle {@link #ACTION_DEVICE_ADMIN_ENABLED} and require the
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN} permission.  A typical
 * manifest entry would look like:</p>
 *
 * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/AndroidManifest.xml device_admin_declaration}
 *
 * <p>The meta-data referenced here provides addition information specific
 * to the device administrator, as parsed by the {@link DeviceAdminInfo} class.
 * A typical file would be:</p>
 *
 * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/xml/device_admin_sample.xml meta_data}
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about device administration, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html">Device Administration</a>
 * developer guide.</p>
