/**
 * An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.  Almost all
 * activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
 * creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
 * {@link #setContentView}.  While activities are often presented to the user
 * as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating
 * windows (via a theme with {@link android.R.attr#windowIsFloating} set)
 * or embedded inside of another activity (using {@link ActivityGroup}).
 *
 * There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link #onCreate} is where you initialize your activity.  Most
 *     importantly, here you will usually call {@link #setContentView(int)}
 *     with a layout resource defining your UI, and using {@link #findViewById}
 *     to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with
 *     programmatically.
 * 
 *     <li> {@link #onPause} is where you deal with the user leaving your
 *     activity.  Most importantly, any changes made by the user should at this
 *     point be committed (usually to the
 *     {@link android.content.ContentProvider} holding the data).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To be of use with {@link android.content.Context#startActivity Context.startActivity()}, all
 * activity classes must have a corresponding
 * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}
 * declaration in their package's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</p>

 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>The Activity class is an important part of an application's overall lifecycle,
 * and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental
 * part of the platform's application model. For a detailed perspective on the structure of an
 * Android application and how activities behave, please read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html">Application Fundamentals</a> and
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/tasks-and-back-stack.html">Tasks and Back Stack</a>
 * developer guides.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can also find a detailed discussion about how to create activities in the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals/activities.html">Activities</a>
 * developer guide.</p>
 * </div>
 *
 * <a name="Fragments"></a>
 * <h3>Fragments</h3>
 *
 * <p>Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, Activity
 * implementations can make use of the {@link Fragment} class to better
 * modularize their code, build more sophisticated user interfaces for larger
 * screens, and help scale their application between small and large screens.
 *
 * <a name="ActivityLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Activity Lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * <p>Activities in the system are managed as an <em>activity stack</em>.
 * When a new activity is started, it is placed on the top of the stack
 * and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains
 * below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until
 * the new activity exits.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An activity has essentially four states:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li> If an activity in the foreground of the screen (at the top of
 *         the stack),
 *         it is <em>active</em> or  <em>running</em>. </li>
 *     <li>If an activity has lost focus but is still visible (that is, a new non-full-sized
 *         or transparent activity has focus on top of your activity), it 
 *         is <em>paused</em>. A paused activity is completely alive (it
 *         maintains all state and member information and remains attached to
 *         the window manager), but can be killed by the system in extreme
 *         low memory situations.
 *     <li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity,
 *         it is <em>stopped</em>. It still retains all state and member information,
 *         however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden
 *         and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed
 *         elsewhere.</li>
 *     <li>If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity
 *         from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its
 *         process.  When it is displayed again to the user, it must be
 *         completely restarted and restored to its previous state.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following diagram shows the important state paths of an Activity.
 * The square rectangles represent callback methods you can implement to
 * perform operations when the Activity moves between states.  The colored
 * ovals are major states the Activity can be in.</p>
 * 
 * <p><img src="../../../images/activity_lifecycle.png"
 *      alt="State diagram for an Android Activity Lifecycle." border="0" /></p>
 * 
 * <p>There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your
 * activity:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <b>entire lifetime</b> of an activity happens between the first call
 * to {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} through to a single final call
 * to {@link android.app.Activity#onDestroy}.  An activity will do all setup
 * of "global" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in
 * onDestroy().  For example, if it has a thread running in the background
 * to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate()
 * and then stop the thread in onDestroy().
 * 
 * <li>The <b>visible lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onStart} until a corresponding call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}.  During this time the user can see the
 * activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting
 * with the user.  Between these two methods you can maintain resources that
 * are needed to show the activity to the user.  For example, you can register
 * a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} in onStart() to monitor for changes
 * that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no
 * longer sees what you are displaying.  The onStart() and onStop() methods
 * can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden
 * to the user.
 * 
 * <li>The <b>foreground lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onResume} until a corresponding call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}.  During this time the activity is
 * in front of all other activities and interacting with the user.  An activity
 * can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when
 * the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new
 * intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly
 * lightweight.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following
 * Activity methods.  All of these are hooks that you can override
 * to do appropriate work when the activity changes state.  All
 * activities will implement {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate}
 * to do their initial setup; many will also implement
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onPause} to commit changes to data and
 * otherwise prepare to stop interacting with the user.  You should always
 * call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.</p>
 *
 * </p>

 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Note the "Killable" column in the above table -- for those methods that
 * are marked as being killable, after that method returns the process hosting the
 * activity may killed by the system <em>at any time</em> without another line
 * of its code being executed.  Because of this, you should use the
 * {@link #onPause} method to write any persistent data (such as user edits)
 * to storage.  In addition, the method
 * {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} is called before placing the activity
 * in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance
 * state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in
 * {@link #onCreate} if the activity needs to be re-created.  
 * See the <a href="#ProcessLifecycle">Process Lifecycle</a>
 * section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied
 * to the activities it is hosting.  Note that it is important to save
 * persistent data in {@link #onPause} instead of {@link #onSaveInstanceState}
 * because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not
 * be called in every situation as described in its documentation.</p>
 *
 * <p class="note">Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between
 * applications targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}
 * vs. those targeting prior platforms.  Starting with Honeycomb, an application
 * is not in the killable state until its {@link #onStop} has returned.  This
 * impacts when {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} may be called (it may be
 * safely called after {@link #onPause()} and allows and application to safely
 * wait until {@link #onStop()} to save persistent state.</p>
 *
 * <p>For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity's
 * process will not be killed by the system starting from the time the method
 * is called and continuing after it returns.  Thus an activity is in the killable
 * state, for example, between after <code>onPause()</code> to the start of
 * <code>onResume()</code>.</p>
 *
 * <a name="ConfigurationChanges"></a>
 * <h3>Configuration Changes</h3>
 * 
 * <p>If the configuration of the device (as defined by the
 * {@link Configuration Resources.Configuration} class) changes,
 * then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that
 * configuration.  Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting
 * with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration
 * changes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change
 * in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your
 * current activity to be <em>destroyed</em>, going through the normal activity
 * lifecycle process of {@link #onPause},
 * {@link #onStop}, and {@link #onDestroy} as appropriate.  If the activity
 * had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once {@link #onDestroy} is
 * called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be
 * created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated
 * from {@link #onSaveInstanceState}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is done because any application resource,
 * including layout files, can change based on any configuration value.  Thus
 * the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all
 * resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings.  Because activities
 * must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from
 * that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself
 * with a new configuration.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your
 * activity based on one or more types of configuration changes.  This is
 * done with the {@link android.R.attr#configChanges android:configChanges}
 * attribute in its manifest.  For any types of configuration changes you say
 * that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's
 * {@link #onConfigurationChanged} method instead of being restarted.  If
 * a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the
 * activity will still be restarted and {@link #onConfigurationChanged}
 * will not be called.</p>
 * 
 * <a name="StartingActivities"></a>
 * <h3>Starting Activities and Getting Results</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link android.app.Activity#startActivity}
 * method is used to start a
 * new activity, which will be placed at the top of the activity stack.  It
 * takes a single argument, an {@link android.content.Intent Intent},
 * which describes the activity
 * to be executed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it
 * ends.  For example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick
 * a person in a list of contacts; when it ends, it returns the person
 * that was selected.  To do this, you call the
 * {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)} 
 * version with a second integer parameter identifying the call.  The result 
 * will come back through your {@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult}
 * method.</p> 
 *
 * <p>When an activity exits, it can call
 * {@link android.app.Activity#setResult(int)}
 * to return data back to its parent.  It must always supply a result code,
 * which can be the standard results RESULT_CANCELED, RESULT_OK, or any
 * custom values starting at RESULT_FIRST_USER.  In addition, it can optionally
 * return back an Intent containing any additional data it wants.  All of this
 * information appears back on the
 * parent's <code>Activity.onActivityResult()</code>, along with the integer
 * identifier it originally supplied.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent
 * activity will receive a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.</p>
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * public class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *     ...
 *
 *     static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;
 *
 *     protected boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
 *         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
 *             // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
 *             startActivityForResult(
 *                 new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
 *                 new Uri("content://contacts")),
 *                 PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);
 *            return true;
 *         }
 *         return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
 *             Intent data) {
 *         if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
 *             if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
 *                 // A contact was picked.  Here we will just display it
 *                 // to the user.
 *                 startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, data));
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <a name="SavingPersistentState"></a>
 * <h3>Saving Persistent State</h3>
 *
 * <p>There are generally two kinds of persistent state than an activity
 * will deal with: shared document-like data (typically stored in a SQLite
 * database using a {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content provider})
 * and internal state such as user preferences.</p>
 *
 * <p>For content provider data, we suggest that activities use a
 * "edit in place" user model.  That is, any edits a user makes are effectively
 * made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step.
 * Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <p>When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for
 *             it is created immediately.  For example, if the user chooses to write
 *             a new e-mail, a new entry for that e-mail is created as soon as they
 *             start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after
 *             that point this e-mail will now appear in the list of drafts.</p>
 *     <li> <p>When an activity's <code>onPause()</code> method is called, it should
 *             commit to the backing content provider or file any changes the user
 *             has made.  This ensures that those changes will be seen by any other
 *             activity that is about to run.  You will probably want to commit
 *             your data even more aggressively at key times during your
 *             activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new
 *             activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user
 *             switches between input fields, etc.</p>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating
 * between activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because
 * system resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been
 * paused.  Note this implies
 * that the user pressing BACK from your activity does <em>not</em>
 * mean "cancel" -- it means to leave the activity with its current contents
 * saved away.  Canceling edits in an activity must be provided through
 * some other mechanism, such as an explicit "revert" or "undo" option.</p>
 *
 * <p>See the {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content package} for
 * more information about content providers.  These are a key aspect of how
 * different activities invoke and propagate data between themselves.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Activity class also provides an API for managing internal persistent state
 * associated with an activity.  This can be used, for example, to remember
 * the user's preferred initial display in a calendar (day view or week view)
 * or the user's default home page in a web browser.</p>
 *
 * <p>Activity persistent state is managed
 * with the method {@link #getPreferences},
 * allowing you to retrieve and
 * modify a set of name/value pairs associated with the activity.  To use
 * preferences that are shared across multiple application components
 * (activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the underlying
 * {@link Context#getSharedPreferences Context.getSharedPreferences()} method
 * to retrieve a preferences
 * object stored under a specific name.
 * (Note that it is not possible to share settings data across application

 * <h3>Permissions</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is
 * declared in its
 * manifest's {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}
 * tag.  By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding
 * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestUsesPermission &lt;uses-permission&gt;}
 * element in their own manifest to be able to start that activity.
 *
 * <p>When starting an Activity you can set {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
 * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION
 * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} on the Intent.  This will grant the
 * Activity access to the specific URIs in the Intent.  Access will remain
 * until the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting
 * process being killed and other temporary destruction).  As of
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#GINGERBREAD}, if the Activity
 * was already created and a new Intent is being delivered to
 * {@link #onNewIntent(Intent)}, any newly granted URI permissions will be added
 * to the existing ones it holds.
 *
 * <p>See the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and Permissions</a>
 * document for more information on permissions and security in general.
 * 
 * <a name="ProcessLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Process Lifecycle</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The Android system attempts to keep application process around for as
 * long as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when
 * memory runs low.  As described in <a href="#ActivityLifecycle">Activity
 * Lifecycle</a>, the decision about which process to remove is intimately
 * tied to the state of the user's interaction with it.  In general, there
 * are four states a process can be in based on the activities running in it,
 * listed here in order of importance.  The system will kill less important
 * processes (the last ones) before it resorts to killing more important
 * processes (the first ones).
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li> <p>The <b>foreground activity</b> (the activity at the top of the screen
 * that the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important.
 * Its process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory
 * than is available on the device.  Generally at this point the device has
 * reached a memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user
 * interface responsive.
 * <li> <p>A <b>visible activity</b> (an activity that is visible to the user
 * but not in the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog)
 * is considered extremely important and will not be killed unless that is
 * required to keep the foreground activity running.
 * <li> <p>A <b>background activity</b> (an activity that is not visible to
 * the user and has been paused) is no longer critical, so the system may
 * safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or
 * visible processes.  If its process needs to be killed, when the user navigates
 * back to the activity (making it visible on the screen again), its
 * {@link #onCreate} method will be called with the savedInstanceState it had previously
 * supplied in {@link #onSaveInstanceState} so that it can restart itself in the same
 * state as the user last left it.
 * <li> <p>An <b>empty process</b> is one hosting no activities or other
 * application components (such as {@link Service} or
 * {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} classes).  These are killed very
 * quickly by the system as memory becomes low.  For this reason, any
 * background operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the
 * context of an activity BroadcastReceiver or Service to ensure that the system
 * knows it needs to keep your process around.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists
 * independently of the activity lifecycle itself.  An example may be a camera
 * application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site.  The upload
 * may take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave
 * the application will it is executing.  To accomplish this, your Activity
 * should start a {@link Service} in which the upload takes place.  This allows
 * the system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more
 * important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the
 * upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped,
 * or finished.

     * <p>This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
     * comes back some time in the future it can restore its state.  For example,
     * if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
     * A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
     * current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user

     * via {@link #onCreate} or {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}.

     * <p>Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as
     * {@link #onPause}, which is always called when an activity is being placed
     * in the background or on its way to destruction, or {@link #onStop} which
     * is called before destruction.  One example of when {@link #onPause} and
     * {@link #onStop} is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
     * from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call {@link #onSaveInstanceState}
     * on B because that particular instance will never be restored, so the
     * system avoids calling it.  An example when {@link #onPause} is called and
     * not {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is when activity B is launched in front of activity A:
     * the system may avoid calling {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on activity A if it isn't
     * killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
     * A will stay intact.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
     * state for you by calling {@link android.view.View#onSaveInstanceState()} on each
     * view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
     * focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}).  If you override this method to save additional
     * information not captured by each individual view, you will likely want to
     * call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
     * all of the state of each view yourself.
