 * <u>Definition of the coordinate system used by the SensorEvent API.</u>

 *
 * <p>
 * The coordinate-system is defined relative to the screen of the phone in its
 * default orientation. The axes are not swapped when the device's screen
 * orientation changes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The X axis is horizontal and points to the right, the Y axis is vertical and
 * points up and the Z axis points towards the outside of the front face of the
 * screen. In this system, coordinates behind the screen have negative Z values.

     * <p>
     * The length and contents of the {@link #values values} array depends on
     * which {@link android.hardware.Sensor sensor} type is being monitored (see
     * also {@link SensorEvent} for a definition of the coordinate system used).
     * </p>
     *
     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
     * Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER}:</h4> All values are in SI units (m/s^2)
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> values[0]: Acceleration minus Gx on the x-axis </li>
     * <li> values[1]: Acceleration minus Gy on the y-axis </li>
     * <li> values[2]: Acceleration minus Gz on the z-axis </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * A sensor of this type measures the acceleration applied to the device
     * (<b>Ad</b>). Conceptually, it does so by measuring forces applied to the
     * sensor itself (<b>Fs</b>) using the relation:
     * </p>
     *
     * <b><center>Ad = - &#8721;Fs / mass</center></b>
     *
     * <p>
     * In particular, the force of gravity is always influencing the measured
     * acceleration:
     * </p>
     *
     * <b><center>Ad = -g - &#8721;F / mass</center></b>
     *
     * <p>
     * For this reason, when the device is sitting on a table (and obviously not
     * accelerating), the accelerometer reads a magnitude of <b>g</b> = 9.81
     * m/s^2
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Similarly, when the device is in free-fall and therefore dangerously
     * accelerating towards to ground at 9.81 m/s^2, its accelerometer reads a
     * magnitude of 0 m/s^2.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * It should be apparent that in order to measure the real acceleration of
     * the device, the contribution of the force of gravity must be eliminated.
     * This can be achieved by applying a <i>high-pass</i> filter. Conversely, a
     * <i>low-pass</i> filter can be used to isolate the force of gravity.

     * <u>Examples</u>:

     *
     * <li>When the device lies flat on a table, the acceleration value is

     *
     * <li>When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed toward the sky
     * with an acceleration of A m/s^2, the acceleration value is equal to

     * Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD}:</h4>

     * </h4> All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation
     * around the device's local X, Y and Z axis. The coordinate system is the
     * same as is used for the acceleration sensor. Rotation is positive in the
     * counter-clockwise direction. That is, an observer looking from some
     * positive location on the x, y or z axis at a device positioned on the
     * origin would report positive rotation if the device appeared to be
     * rotating counter clockwise. Note that this is the standard mathematical
     * definition of positive rotation and does not agree with the definition of
     * roll given earlier.

     * (without using the earth's geomagnetic field). However, the orientation
     * may drift somewhat over time. See {@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR}

     * <h4> {@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED
     * Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED}:</h4>
     * All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation
     * around the X, Y and Z axis. An estimation of the drift on each axis is
     * reported as well.
     * <p>
     * No gyro-drift compensation is performed. Factory calibration and temperature
     * compensation is still applied to the rate of rotation (angular speeds).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The coordinate system is the same as is used for the
     * {@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ACCELEROMETER}
     * Rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction (right-hand rule).
     * That is, an observer looking from some positive location on the x, y or z axis
     * at a device positioned on the origin would report positive rotation if the device
     * appeared to be rotating counter clockwise.
     * The range would at least be 17.45 rad/s (ie: ~1000 deg/s).
     * <ul>
     * <li> values[0] : angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the X axis in rad/s </li>
     * <li> values[1] : angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the Y axis in rad/s </li>
     * <li> values[2] : angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the Z axis in rad/s </li>

     * on it. In earlier versions, this used to be always 3 which has changed now. </p>
