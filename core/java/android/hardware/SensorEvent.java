 * <u>Definition of the coordinate system used by the SensorEvent API.</u>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The coordinate-system is defined relative to the screen of the phone in its
 * default orientation. The axes are not swapped when the device's screen
 * orientation changes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The X axis is horizontal and points to the right, the Y axis is vertical and
 * points up and the Z axis points towards the outside of the front face of the
 * screen. In this system, coordinates behind the screen have negative Z values.

    /**
     * <p>
     * The length and contents of the {@link #values values} array depends on
     * which {@link android.hardware.Sensor sensor} type is being monitored (see
     * also {@link SensorEvent} for a definition of the coordinate system used).
     * </p>
     *
     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
     * Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER}:</h4> All values are in SI units (m/s^2)
     *
     * <ul>
     * <p>
     * values[0]: Acceleration minus Gx on the x-axis
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * values[1]: Acceleration minus Gy on the y-axis
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * values[2]: Acceleration minus Gz on the z-axis
     * </p>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * A sensor of this type measures the acceleration applied to the device
     * (<b>Ad</b>). Conceptually, it does so by measuring forces applied to the
     * sensor itself (<b>Fs</b>) using the relation:
     * </p>
     *
     * <b><center>Ad = - &#8721;Fs / mass</center></b>
     *
     * <p>
     * In particular, the force of gravity is always influencing the measured
     * acceleration:
     * </p>
     *
     * <b><center>Ad = -g - &#8721;F / mass</center></b>
     *
     * <p>
     * For this reason, when the device is sitting on a table (and obviously not
     * accelerating), the accelerometer reads a magnitude of <b>g</b> = 9.81
     * m/s^2
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Similarly, when the device is in free-fall and therefore dangerously
     * accelerating towards to ground at 9.81 m/s^2, its accelerometer reads a
     * magnitude of 0 m/s^2.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * It should be apparent that in order to measure the real acceleration of
     * the device, the contribution of the force of gravity must be eliminated.
     * This can be achieved by applying a <i>high-pass</i> filter. Conversely, a
     * <i>low-pass</i> filter can be used to isolate the force of gravity.
     * </p>

     *          // alpha is calculated as t / (t + dT)
     *          // with t, the low-pass filter's time-constant

     * <u>Examples</u>:
     * <ul>
     * <li>When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed on its left side
     * toward the right, the x acceleration value is positive.</li>
     *
     * <li>When the device lies flat on a table, the acceleration value is
     * +9.81, which correspond to the acceleration of the device (0 m/s^2) minus
     * the force of gravity (-9.81 m/s^2).</li>
     *
     * <li>When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed toward the sky
     * with an acceleration of A m/s^2, the acceleration value is equal to
     * A+9.81 which correspond to the acceleration of the device (+A m/s^2)
     * minus the force of gravity (-9.81 m/s^2).</li>
     * </ul>

     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD
     * Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD}:</h4>
     * All values are in micro-Tesla (uT) and measure the ambient magnetic field
     * in the X, Y and Z axis.
     *
     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_GYROSCOPE Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE}:</h4>
     *  All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation
     *  around the X, Y and Z axis. The coordinate system is the same as is
     *  used for the acceleration sensor.  Rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise
     *  direction.  That is, an observer looking from some positive location on the x, y.
     *  or z axis at a device positioned on the origin would report positive rotation
     *  if the device appeared to be rotating counter clockwise.  Note that this is the
     *  standard mathematical definition of positive rotation and does not agree with the
     *  definition of roll given earlier.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <p>
     * values[0]: Angular speed around the x-axis

     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Typically the output of the gyroscope is integrated over time to calculate
     * an angle, for example:

     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *     private static final float NS2S = 1.0f / 1000000000.0f;
     *     private float timestamp;
     *     public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event)
     *     {
     *          if (timestamp != 0) {
     *              final float dT = (event.timestamp - timestamp) * NS2S;
     *              angle[0] += event.data[0] * dT;
     *              angle[1] += event.data[1] * dT;
     *              angle[2] += event.data[2] * dT;
     *          }
     *          timestamp = event.timestamp;
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>In practice, the gyroscope noise and offset will introduce some errors which need
     * to be compensated for. This is usually done using the information from other
     * sensors, but is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_LIGHT Sensor.TYPE_LIGHT}:</h4>
     * <ul>
     * <p>

     * <ul>
     * <p>
     * values[0]: Proximity sensor distance measured in centimeters
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> Some proximity sensors only support a binary <i>near</i> or
     * <i>far</i> measurement. In this case, the sensor should report its
     * {@link android.hardware.Sensor#getMaximumRange() maximum range} value in

     * </p>
     *
     *  <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_GRAVITY Sensor.TYPE_GRAVITY}:</h4>
     *  <p>A three dimensional vector indicating the direction and magnitude of gravity.  Units
     *  are m/s^2. The coordinate system is the same as is used by the acceleration sensor.</p>
     *  <p><b>Note:</b> When the device is at rest, the output of the gravity sensor should be identical
     *  to that of the accelerometer.</p>
     *
     *  <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION Sensor.TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION}:</h4>
     *  A three dimensional vector indicating acceleration along each device axis, not including
     *  gravity.  All values have units of m/s^2.  The coordinate system is the same as is used by the
     *  acceleration sensor.
     *  <p>The output of the accelerometer, gravity and  linear-acceleration sensors must obey the
     *  following relation:</p>
     *   <p><ul>acceleration = gravity + linear-acceleration</ul></p>
     *
     *  <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR}:</h4>
     *  <p>The rotation vector represents the orientation of the device as a combination of an <i>angle</i>
     *  and an <i>axis</i>, in which the device has rotated through an angle &#952 around an axis
     *  &lt;x, y, z>.</p>
     *  <p>The three elements of the rotation vector are
     *  &lt;x*sin(&#952/2), y*sin(&#952/2), z*sin(&#952/2)>, such that the magnitude of the rotation
     *  vector is equal to sin(&#952/2), and the direction of the rotation vector is equal to the
     *  direction of the axis of rotation.</p>
     *  </p>The three elements of the rotation vector are equal to
     *  the last three components of a <b>unit</b> quaternion
     *  &lt;cos(&#952/2), x*sin(&#952/2), y*sin(&#952/2), z*sin(&#952/2)>.</p>
     *  <p>Elements of the rotation vector are unitless.
     *  The x,y, and z axis are defined in the same way as the acceleration
     *  sensor.</p>

     *
     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_ORIENTATION
     * Sensor.TYPE_ORIENTATION}:</h4> All values are angles in degrees.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <p>
     * values[0]: Azimuth, angle between the magnetic north direction and the
     * y-axis, around the z-axis (0 to 359). 0=North, 90=East, 180=South,
     * 270=West
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * values[1]: Pitch, rotation around x-axis (-180 to 180), with positive
     * values when the z-axis moves <b>toward</b> the y-axis.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * values[2]: Roll, rotation around y-axis (-90 to 90), with positive values
     * when the x-axis moves <b>toward</b> the z-axis.
     * </p>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> This definition is different from <b>yaw, pitch and roll</b>
     * used in aviation where the X axis is along the long side of the plane
     * (tail to nose).
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> This sensor type exists for legacy reasons, please use
     * {@link android.hardware.SensorManager#getRotationMatrix

     *
     * <p>

     * in the clockwise direction (mathematically speaking, it should be
     * positive in the counter-clockwise direction).
