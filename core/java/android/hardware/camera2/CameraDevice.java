     *
     * <p>Surfaces suitable for inclusion as a camera output can be created for
     * various use cases and targets:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>For drawing to a {@link android.view.SurfaceView SurfaceView}: Once the SurfaceView's
     *   Surface is {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback#surfaceCreated created}, set the size
     *   of the Surface with {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#setFixedSize} to be one of the sizes
     *   returned by {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class)
     *   getOutputSizes(SurfaceHolder.class)} and then obtain the Surface by calling {@link
     *   android.view.SurfaceHolder#getSurface}. If the size is not set by the application, it will
     *   be rounded to the nearest supported size less than 1080p, by the camera device.</li>
     *
     * <li>For accessing through an OpenGL texture via a {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture
     *   SurfaceTexture}: Set the size of the SurfaceTexture with {@link
     *   android.graphics.SurfaceTexture#setDefaultBufferSize} to be one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(SurfaceTexture.class)}
     *   before creating a Surface from the SurfaceTexture with {@link Surface#Surface}. If the size
     *   is not set by the application, it will be set to be the smallest supported size less than
     *   1080p, by the camera device.</li>
     *
     * <li>For recording with {@link android.media.MediaCodec}: Call
     *   {@link android.media.MediaCodec#createInputSurface} after configuring
     *   the media codec to use one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(MediaCodec.class)}
     *   </li>
     *
     * <li>For recording with {@link android.media.MediaRecorder}: Call
     *   {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#getSurface} after configuring the media recorder to use
     *   one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(MediaRecorder.class)},
     *   or configuring it to use one of the supported
     *   {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile CamcorderProfiles}.</li>
     *
     * <li>For efficient YUV processing with {@link android.renderscript}:
     *   Create a RenderScript
     *   {@link android.renderscript.Allocation Allocation} with a supported YUV
     *   type, the IO_INPUT flag, and one of the sizes returned by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class) getOutputSizes(Allocation.class)},
     *   Then obtain the Surface with
     *   {@link android.renderscript.Allocation#getSurface}.</li>
     *
     * <li>For access to RAW, uncompressed YUV, or compressed JPEG data in the application: Create an
     *   {@link android.media.ImageReader} object with one of the supported output formats given by
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputFormats()}, setting its size to one of the
     *   corresponding supported sizes by passing the chosen output format into
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(int)}. Then obtain a
     *   {@link android.view.Surface} from it with {@link android.media.ImageReader#getSurface()}.
     *   If the ImageReader size is not set to a supported size, it will be rounded to a supported
     *   size less than 1080p by the camera device.
     *   </li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The camera device will query each Surface's size and formats upon this
     * call, so they must be set to a valid setting at this time.</p>
     *
     * <p>It can take several hundred milliseconds for the session's configuration to complete,
     * since camera hardware may need to be powered on or reconfigured. Once the configuration is
     * complete and the session is ready to actually capture data, the provided
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback}'s
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured} callback will be called.</p>
     *
     * <p>If a prior CameraCaptureSession already exists when this method is called, the previous
     * session will no longer be able to accept new capture requests and will be closed. Any
     * in-progress capture requests made on the prior session will be completed before it's closed.
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateListener#onConfigured} for the new session may be invoked
     * before {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateListener#onClosed} is invoked for the prior
     * session. Once the new session is {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateListener#onConfigured
     * configured}, it is able to start capturing its own requests. To minimize the transition time,
     * the {@link CameraCaptureSession#abortCaptures} call can be used to discard the remaining
     * requests for the prior capture session before a new one is created. Note that once the new
     * session is created, the old one can no longer have its captures aborted.</p>
     *
     * <p>Using larger resolution outputs, or more outputs, can result in slower
     * output rate from the device.</p>
     *
     * <p>Configuring a session with an empty or null list will close the current session, if
     * any. This can be used to release the current session's target surfaces for another use.</p>
     *
     * <p>While any of the sizes from {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes} can be used when
     * a single output stream is configured, a given camera device may not be able to support all
     * combination of sizes, formats, and targets when multiple outputs are configured at once.  The
     * tables below list the maximum guaranteed resolutions for combinations of streams and targets,
     * given the capabilities of the camera device.</p>
     *
     * <p>If an application tries to create a session using a set of targets that exceed the limits
     * described in the below tables, one of three possibilities may occur. First, the session may
     * be successfully created and work normally. Second, the session may be successfully created,
     * but the camera device won't meet the frame rate guarantees as described in
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputMinFrameDuration}. Or third, if the output set
     * cannot be used at all, session creation will fail entirely, with
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateListener#onConfigureFailed} being invoked.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the type column, {@code PRIV} refers to any target whose available sizes are found
     * using {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes(Class)} with no direct application-visible
     * format, {@code YUV} refers to a target Surface using the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#YUV_420_888} format, {@code JPEG} refers to the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#JPEG} format, and {@code RAW} refers to the
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#RAW_SENSOR} format.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the maximum size column, {@code PREVIEW} refers to the best size match to the
     * device's screen resolution, or to 1080p ({@code 1920x1080}), whichever is
     * smaller. {@code RECORD} refers to the camera device's maximum supported recording resolution,
     * as determined by {@link android.media.CamcorderProfile}. And {@code MAXIMUM} refers to the
     * camera device's maximum output resolution for that format or target from
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes}.</p>
     *
     * <p>To use these tables, determine the number and the formats/targets of outputs needed, and
     * find the row(s) of the table with those targets. The sizes indicate the maximum set of sizes
     * that can be used; it is guaranteed that for those targets, the listed sizes and anything
     * smaller from the list given by {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes} can be
     * successfully used to create a session.  For example, if a row indicates that a 8 megapixel
     * (MP) YUV_420_888 output can be used together with a 2 MP {@code PRIV} output, then a session
     * can be created with targets {@code [8 MP YUV, 2 MP PRIV]} or targets {@code [2 MP YUV, 2 MP
     * PRIV]}; but a session with targets {@code [8 MP YUV, 4 MP PRIV]}, targets {@code [4 MP YUV, 4
     * MP PRIV]}, or targets {@code [8 MP PRIV, 2 MP YUV]} would not be guaranteed to work, unless
     * some other row of the table lists such a combination.</p>

     * Create a new reprocessable camera capture session by providing the desired reprocessing

     *
     * <p>If a camera device supports YUV reprocessing
     * ({@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_YUV_REPROCESSING}) or PRIVATE
     * reprocessing
     * ({@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_PRIVATE_REPROCESSING}), besides
     * the capture session created via {@link #createCaptureSession createCaptureSession}, the
     * application can also create a reprocessable capture session to submit reprocess capture
     * requests in addition to regular capture requests. A reprocess capture request takes the next
     * available buffer from the session's input Surface, and sends it through the camera device's
     * processing pipeline again, to produce buffers for the request's target output Surfaces. No
     * new image data is captured for a reprocess request. However the input buffer provided by
     * the application must be captured previously by the same camera device in the same session
     * directly (e.g. for Zero-Shutter-Lag use case) or indirectly (e.g. combining multiple output
     * images).</p>
     *
     * <p>The active reprocessable capture session determines an input {@link Surface} and the set
     * of potential output Surfaces for the camera devices for each capture request. The application
     * can use {@link #createCaptureRequest createCaptureRequest} to create regular capture requests
     * to capture new images from the camera device, and use {@link #createReprocessCaptureRequest
     * createReprocessCaptureRequest} to create reprocess capture requests to process buffers from
     * the input {@link Surface}. Some combinations of output Surfaces in a session may not be used
     * in a request simultaneously. The guaranteed combinations of output Surfaces that can be used
     * in a request simultaneously are listed in the tables under {@link #createCaptureSession
     * createCaptureSession}. All the output Surfaces in one capture request will come from the
     * same source, either from a new capture by the camera device, or from the input Surface
     * depending on if the request is a reprocess capture request.</p>
     *
     * <p>Input formats and sizes supported by the camera device can be queried via
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getInputFormats} and
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getInputSizes}. For each supported input format, the camera
     * device supports a set of output formats and sizes for reprocessing that can be queried via
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getValidOutputFormatsForInput} and
     * {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes}. While output Surfaces with formats that
     * aren't valid reprocess output targets for the input configuration can be part of a session,
     * they cannot be used as targets for a reprocessing request.</p>
     *
     * <p>Since the application cannot access {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#PRIVATE} images
     * directly, an output Surface created by {@link android.media.ImageReader#newInstance} with
     * {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#PRIVATE} as the format will be considered as intended to
     * be used for reprocessing input and thus the {@link android.media.ImageReader} size must
     * match one of the supported input sizes for {@link android.graphics.ImageFormat#PRIVATE}
     * format. Otherwise, creating a reprocessable capture session will fail.</p>
     *
     * <p>The guaranteed stream configurations listed in
     * {@link #createCaptureSession createCaptureSession} are also guaranteed to work for
     * {@link #createReprocessableCaptureSession createReprocessableCaptureSession}. In addition,
     * the configurations in the tables below are also guaranteed for creating a reprocessable
     * capture session if the camera device supports YUV reprocessing or PRIVATE reprocessing.
     * However, not all output targets used to create a reprocessable session may be used in a
     * {@link CaptureRequest} simultaneously. For devices that support only 1 output target in a
     * reprocess {@link CaptureRequest}, submitting a reprocess {@link CaptureRequest} with multiple
     * output targets will result in a {@link CaptureFailure}. For devices that support multiple
     * output targets in a reprocess {@link CaptureRequest}, the guaranteed output targets that can
     * be included in a {@link CaptureRequest} simultaneously are listed in the tables under
     * {@link #createCaptureSession createCaptureSession}. For example, with a FULL-capability
     * ({@link CameraCharacteristics#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL} {@code == }
     * {@link CameraMetadata#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_FULL FULL}) device that supports PRIVATE
     * reprocessing, an application can create a reprocessable capture session with 1 input,
     * ({@code PRIV}, {@code MAXIMUM}), and 3 outputs, ({@code PRIV}, {@code MAXIMUM}),
     * ({@code PRIV}, {@code PREVIEW}), and ({@code YUV}, {@code MAXIMUM}). However, it's not
     * guaranteed that an application can submit a regular or reprocess capture with ({@code PRIV},
     * {@code MAXIMUM}) and ({@code YUV}, {@code MAXIMUM}) outputs based on the table listed under
     * {@link #createCaptureSession createCaptureSession}. In other words, use the tables below to
     * determine the guaranteed stream configurations for creating a reprocessable capture session,

     * <p>Create a new constrained high speed capture session.</p>
     *
     * <p>The application can use normal capture session (created via {@link #createCaptureSession})
     * for high speed capture if the desired high speed FPS ranges are advertised by
     * {@link CameraCharacteristics#CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES}, in which case all API
     * semantics associated with normal capture sessions applies.</p>
     *
     * <p>The method creates a specialized capture session that is only targeted at high speed
     * video recording (>=120fps) use case if the camera device supports high speed video
     * capability (i.e., {@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES} contains
     * {@link CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO}).
     * Therefore, it has special characteristics compared with a normal capture session:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>In addition to the output target Surface requirements specified by the
     *   {@link #createCaptureSession} method, an active high speed capture session will support up
     *   to 2 output Surfaces, though the application might choose to configure just one Surface
     *   (e.g., preview only). All Surfaces must be either video encoder surfaces (acquired by
     *   {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#getSurface} or
     *   {@link android.media.MediaCodec#createInputSurface}) or preview surfaces (obtained from
     *   {@link android.view.SurfaceView}, {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture} via
     *   {@link android.view.Surface#Surface(android.graphics.SurfaceTexture)}). The Surface sizes
     *   must be one of the sizes reported by {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getHighSpeedVideoSizes}.
     *   When multiple Surfaces are configured, their size must be same.</li>
     *
     * <li>An active high speed capture session only accepts request lists created via
     *   {@link CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession#createHighSpeedRequestList}, and the
     *   request list can only be submitted to this session via
     *   {@link CameraCaptureSession#captureBurst captureBurst}, or
     *   {@link CameraCaptureSession#setRepeatingBurst setRepeatingBurst}.</li>
     *
     * <li>The FPS ranges being requested to this session must be selected from
     *   {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor}. The application can still use
     *   {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE} to control the desired FPS range.
     *   Switching to an FPS range that has different
     *   {@link android.util.Range#getUpper() maximum FPS} may trigger some camera device
     *   reconfigurations, which may introduce extra latency. It is recommended that the
     *   application avoids unnecessary maximum target FPS changes as much as possible during high
     *   speed streaming.</li>
     *
     * <li>For the request lists submitted to this session, the camera device will override the
     *   {@link CaptureRequest#CONTROL_MODE control mode}, auto-exposure (AE), auto-white balance
     *   (AWB) and auto-focus (AF) to {@link CameraMetadata#CONTROL_MODE_AUTO},
     *   {@link CameraMetadata#CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON}, {@link CameraMetadata#CONTROL_AWB_MODE_AUTO}
     *   and {@link CameraMetadata#CONTROL_AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO}, respectively. All
     *   post-processing block mode controls will be overridden to be FAST. Therefore, no manual
     *   control of capture and post-processing parameters is possible. Beside these, only a subset
     *   of controls will work, see
     *   {@link CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO} for
     *   more details.</li>
