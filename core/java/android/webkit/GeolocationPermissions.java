/**
 * This class is used to manage permissions for the WebView's Geolocation
 * JavaScript API.
 *
 * Geolocation permissions are applied to an origin, which consists of the
 * host, scheme and port of a URI. In order for web content to use the
 * Geolocation API, permission must be granted for that content's origin.
 *
 * This class stores Geolocation permissions. An origin's permission state can
 * be either allowed or denied. This class uses Strings to represent
 * an origin.
 *
 * When an origin attempts to use the Geolocation API, but no permission state
 * is currently set for that origin,
 * {@link WebChromeClient#onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String,GeolocationPermissions.Callback) WebChromeClient.onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt()}
 * is called. This allows the permission state to be set for that origin.
 *
 * The methods of this class can be used to modify and interrogate the stored
 * Geolocation permissions at any time.
