  Description
=========================================================================================

The PerfLock APIs can be used in either the framework or in packaged applications.
The APIs toggle system performance optimizations based upon level requested.
PerfLock will always run the highest level of optimization requested.

NOTE: Each instance of the Performance class object will serve one unique PerfLock request.
      Therefore, a new Performance class object will need to be created for every
      unique request for PerfLock.

Please read through the following carefully to understand the proper usage of this API.

=========================================================================================
  PerfLock APIs
=========================================================================================

The following two methods are the PerfLock APIs

1. perfLockAcquire(int duration, int... args)

    Description:

        Toggle on all optimizations requested.

    Arguments:

        duration: The maximum amount of time required to hold the lock.
                  Only a positive integer value in milliseconds will be accepted.
                  You may explicitly call perfLockRelease before the timer expires.

        args: Enter all optimizations required. Only the optimizations in the
              table below are supported. You can only choose one optimization
              from each of the numbered sections in the table. Incorrect or
              unsupported optimizations will be ignored.

              NOTE: Enter the optimizations required in the order they appear in the table.

    Returns: On success, a non-zero integer handle is returned, you must store this.
             On error, a NULL pointer is returned.

2. perfLockRelease() [OPTIONAL]

    Description:

        Toggle off all optimizations requested.
        Use this function if you want to release before the time duration ends.

    Arguments: None.

    Returns: REQUEST_SUCCEEDED or REQUEST_FAILED.

| For the following CPU FREQ resources, please read carefully on the usage.                     |
| All frequencies available on the device are supported. In order to use an intermediate        |
| frequency not specified with an enum, you will need to pass in a valid hex value.             |
| The leftmost byte represents the CPU and the rightmost byte represents the frequency.         |
| The hex value used will be multiplied by 10^5 to calculate the minimum frequency requested.   |
| This calculated frequency or the next highest frequency available will be set.                |
|                                                                                               |
| Example: Set CPU0 frequency to a minimum of 700 Mhz                                           |
|          Use 0x207.                                                                           |

=========================================================================================
  PerfLock API usage in framework
=========================================================================================

1. Add "import org.codeaurora.Performance;" in your Java source file

2. Create the Performance class object

3. Use "perfLockAcquire" to request the optmizations required
   and store the returned handle into an int variable.

4. Use "perfLockRelease" to toggle the optimizations off
   NOTE: perfLockRelease is optional but required if the duration
         of acquisition is unknown (ie. 0).
______________________________________________________________________
Example: Request PerfLock for minimum of two cores and set the
         minimum frequency for CPU0 and CPU1 to 1026 Mhz for three seconds.

   Performance mPerf = new Performance();

   mPerf.perfLockAcquire(3000, mPerf.CPUS_ON_2, \
                       mPerf.CPU0_FREQ_LVL_NONTURBO_MAX, mPerf.CPU1_FREQ_LVL_NONTURBO_MAX);

   // Critical section requiring PerfLock

NOTE: perfLockRelease is not required since PerfLock will automatically
      release after three seconds.
______________________________________________________________________
Example: Request PerfLock for minimum of three cores in one section.
         Set duration for five seconds and release before that if possible.

         Request PerfLock for minimum of two cores in another section.
         Set duration for three seconds and release before that if possible.

   Performance mPerf = new Performance();
   Performance sPerf = new Performance();

   mPerf.perfLockAcquire(5000, mPerf.CPUS_ON_3);

   // Critical section requiring PerfLock

   mPerf.perfLockRelease();

   // other code in between

   sPerf.perfLockAcquire(3000, sPerf.CPUS_ON_2);

   // Critical section requiring PerfLock

   sPerf.perfLockRelease();

NOTE: perfLockRelease is recommended to ensure PerfLock is not held for longer
      than it needs to be.

=========================================================================================
  PerfLock APIs usage in packaged applications
=========================================================================================
1. Repeat above steps for using APIs in framework
2. Add "LOCAL_JAVA_LIBRARIES := org.codeaurora.Performance" to the application's Android.mk file
