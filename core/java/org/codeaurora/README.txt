==================================
  Description
==================================

The PerfLock APIs can be used in either the framework or in packaged applications.
The APIs toggle system performance optimizations based upon level requested.

==================================
  PerfLock APIs
==================================

The following two methods are the PerfLock APIs

1. perfLockAcquire(int... args)

    Toggle on all optimizations requested.

    Description: Call perfLockAcquire with the list of optimizations required.
                 perfLockAcquire accepts variable number of arguments, enter all
                 optimizations required at once.

                 See next section below for the optimizations supported.

    Limitations: Only the first five optimizations will be performed.
                 You are only allowed to choose one optimization from each of the
                 numbered sections in the table below.

                 Incorrect or unsupported optimizations will be ignored.

    Returns: REQUEST_SUCCEEDED or REQUEST_FAILED.

2. perfLockRelease()

    Toggle off all optimizations requested.

    Returns: REQUEST_SUCCEEDED or REQUEST_FAILED.

  PerfLock API usage in framework
=====================================

1. Add "import org.codeaurora.Performance;" in your Java source file
2. Create the Performance class object
3. Use "perfLockAcquire" to request the optmizations required
4. Use "perfLockRelease" to toggle the optimizations off
______________________________________________________________________
Example: Request PerfLock to bring up all additional cores and set the
         minimum frequency for CPU0 and CPU1 to 1026 Mhz.

   Performance mPerf = new Performance();
   mPerf.perfLockAcquire(mPerf.CPUS_ON_LVL_MAX, mPerf.CPU0_FREQ_LVL_NONTURBO, mPerf.CPU1_FREQ_LVL_NONTURBO);

   // Critical section requiring PerfLock

   mPerf.perfLockRelease();

=================================================
  PerfLock APIs usage in packaged applications
=================================================
1. Repeat above steps for using APIs in framework
2. Add "LOCAL_JAVA_LIBRARIES := org.codeaurora.Performance" to the application's Android.mk file
