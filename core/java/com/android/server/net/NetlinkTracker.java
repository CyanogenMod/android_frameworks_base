/**
 * Keeps track of link configuration received from Netlink.
 *
 * Instances of this class are expected to be owned by subsystems such as Wi-Fi
 * or Ethernet that manage one or more network interfaces. Each interface to be
 * tracked needs its own {@code NetlinkTracker}.
 *
 * An instance of this class is constructed by passing in an interface name and
 * a callback. The owner is then responsible for registering the tracker with
 * NetworkManagementService. When the class receives update notifications from
 * the NetworkManagementService notification threads, it applies the update to
 * its local LinkProperties, and if something has changed, notifies its owner of
 * the update via the callback.
 *
 * The owner can then call {@code getLinkProperties()} in order to find out
 * what changed. If in the meantime the LinkProperties stored here have changed,
 * this class will return the current LinkProperties. Because each change
 * triggers an update callback after the change is made, the owner may get more
 * callbacks than strictly necessary (some of which may be no-ops), but will not
 * be out of sync once all callbacks have been processed.
 *
 * Threading model:
 *
 * - The owner of this class is expected to create it, register it, and call
 *   getLinkProperties or clearLinkProperties on its thread.
 * - Most of the methods in the class are inherited from BaseNetworkObserver
 *   and are called by NetworkManagementService notification threads.
 * - All accesses to mLinkProperties must be synchronized(this). All the other
 *   member variables are immutable once the object is constructed.
 *
 * This class currently tracks IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In the future it will
 * track routes and DNS servers.

/**
 * Tracks DNS server updates received from Netlink.
 *
 * The network may announce an arbitrary number of DNS servers in Router Advertisements at any
 * time. Each announcement has a lifetime; when the lifetime expires, the servers should not be used
 * any more. In this way, the network can gracefully migrate clients from one set of DNS servers to
 * another. Announcements can both raise and lower the lifetime, and an announcement can expire
 * servers by announcing them with a lifetime of zero.
 *
 * Typically the system will only use a small number (2 or 3; {@code NUM_CURRENT_SERVERS}) of DNS
 * servers at any given time. These are referred to as the current servers. In case all the
 * current servers expire, the class also keeps track of a larger (but limited) number of servers
 * that are promoted to current servers when the current ones expire. In order to minimize updates
 * to the rest of the system (and potentially expensive cache flushes) this class attempts to keep
 * the list of current servers constant where possible. More specifically, the list of current
 * servers is only updated if a new server is learned and there are not yet {@code
 * NUM_CURRENT_SERVERS} current servers, or if one or more of the current servers expires or is
 * pushed out of the set. Therefore, the current servers will not necessarily be the ones with the
 * highest lifetime, but the ones learned first.
 *
 * This is by design: if instead the class always preferred the servers with the highest lifetime, a
 * (misconfigured?) network where two or more routers announce more than {@code NUM_CURRENT_SERVERS}
 * unique servers would cause persistent oscillations.
 *
 * TODO: Currently servers are only expired when a new DNS update is received.
 * Update them using timers, or possibly on every notification received by NetlinkTracker.
 *
 * Threading model: run by NetlinkTracker. Methods are synchronized(this) just in case netlink
 * notifications are sent by multiple threads. If future threads use alarms to expire, those
 * alarms must also be synchronized(this).
