/**
 * The NinePatch class permits drawing a bitmap in nine sections.
 * The four corners are unscaled; the four edges are scaled in one axis,
 * and the middle is scaled in both axes. Normally, the middle is
 * transparent so that the patch can provide a selection about a rectangle.
 * Essentially, it allows the creation of custom graphics that will scale the
 * way that you define, when content added within the image exceeds the normal
 * bounds of the graphic. For a thorough explanation of a NinePatch image,
 * read the discussion in the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#nine-patch">2D
 * Graphics</a> document.
 * <p>
 * The <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/draw9patch.html">Draw 9-Patch</a>
 * tool offers an extremely handy way to create your NinePatch images,
 * using a WYSIWYG graphics editor.
 * </p>
