/**
 * A Drawable is a general abstraction for "something that can be drawn."  Most
 * often you will deal with Drawable as the type of resource retrieved for
 * drawing things to the screen; the Drawable class provides a generic API for
 * dealing with an underlying visual resource that may take a variety of forms.
 * Unlike a {@link android.view.View}, a Drawable does not have any facility to
 * receive events or otherwise interact with the user.
 *
 * <p>In addition to simple drawing, Drawable provides a number of generic
 * mechanisms for its client to interact with what is being drawn:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li> The {@link #setBounds} method <var>must</var> be called to tell the
 *     Drawable where it is drawn and how large it should be.  All Drawables
 *     should respect the requested size, often simply by scaling their
 *     imagery.  A client can find the preferred size for some Drawables with
 *     the {@link #getIntrinsicHeight} and {@link #getIntrinsicWidth} methods.
 *
 *     <li> The {@link #getPadding} method can return from some Drawables
 *     information about how to frame content that is placed inside of them.
 *     For example, a Drawable that is intended to be the frame for a button
 *     widget would need to return padding that correctly places the label
 *     inside of itself.
 *
 *     <li> The {@link #setState} method allows the client to tell the Drawable
 *     in which state it is to be drawn, such as "focused", "selected", etc.
 *     Some drawables may modify their imagery based on the selected state.
 *
 *     <li> The {@link #setLevel} method allows the client to supply a single
 *     continuous controller that can modify the Drawable is displayed, such as
 *     a battery level or progress level.  Some drawables may modify their
 *     imagery based on the current level.
 *
 *     <li> A Drawable can perform animations by calling back to its client
 *     through the {@link Callback} interface.  All clients should support this
 *     interface (via {@link #setCallback}) so that animations will work.  A
 *     simple way to do this is through the system facilities such as
 *     {@link android.view.View#setBackground(Drawable)} and
 *     {@link android.widget.ImageView}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Though usually not visible to the application, Drawables may take a variety
 * of forms:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <b>Bitmap</b>: the simplest Drawable, a PNG or JPEG image.
 *     <li> <b>Nine Patch</b>: an extension to the PNG format allows it to
 *     specify information about how to stretch it and place things inside of
 *     it.
 *     <li> <b>Shape</b>: contains simple drawing commands instead of a raw
 *     bitmap, allowing it to resize better in some cases.
 *     <li> <b>Layers</b>: a compound drawable, which draws multiple underlying
 *     drawables on top of each other.
 *     <li> <b>States</b>: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
 *     drawables based on its state.
 *     <li> <b>Levels</b>: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
 *     drawables based on its level.
 *     <li> <b>Scale</b>: a compound drawable with a single child drawable,
 *     whose overall size is modified based on the current level.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
