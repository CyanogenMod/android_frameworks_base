/**
 * The <code>ServerRequestHandler</code> class defines an event listener that
 * will respond to OBEX requests made to the server.
 * <P>
 * The <code>onConnect()</code>, <code>onSetPath()</code>,
 * <code>onDelete()</code>, <code>onGet()</code>, and <code>onPut()</code>
 * methods may return any response code defined in the
 * <code>ResponseCodes</code> class except for <code>OBEX_HTTP_CONTINUE</code>.
 * If <code>OBEX_HTTP_CONTINUE</code> or a value not defined in the
 * <code>ResponseCodes</code> class is returned, the server implementation will
 * send an <code>OBEX_HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR</code> response to the client.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>Connection ID and Target Headers</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * According to the IrOBEX specification, a packet may not contain a Connection
 * ID and Target header. Since the Connection ID header is managed by the
 * implementation, it will not send a Connection ID header, if a Connection ID
 * was specified, in a packet that has a Target header. In other words, if an
 * application adds a Target header to a <code>HeaderSet</code> object used in
 * an OBEX operation and a Connection ID was specified, no Connection ID will be
 * sent in the packet containing the Target header.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>CREATE-EMPTY Requests</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * A CREATE-EMPTY request allows clients to create empty objects on the server.
 * When a CREATE-EMPTY request is received, the <code>onPut()</code> method will
 * be called by the implementation. To differentiate between a normal PUT
 * request and a CREATE-EMPTY request, an application must open the
 * <code>InputStream</code> from the <code>Operation</code> object passed to the
 * <code>onPut()</code> method. For a PUT request, the application will be able
 * to read Body data from this <code>InputStream</code>. For a CREATE-EMPTY
 * request, there will be no Body data to read. Therefore, a call to
 * <code>InputStream.read()</code> will return -1.
