/**

 * be quite large on some devices.  For small memory devices, being able to
 * terminate all EGL contexts so that this graphics driver memory can be
 * reclaimed can significant improve the overall behavior of the device.  This
 * class helps app developers participate in releasing their EGL context
 * when appropriate and possible.
 *
 * <p>To use, simple instantiate this class with the EGLContext you create.
 * When you have done this, if the device is getting low on memory and all
 * of the currently created EGL contexts in the process are being managed
 * through this class, then they will all be asked to terminate through the
 * call to {@link #onTerminate}.
