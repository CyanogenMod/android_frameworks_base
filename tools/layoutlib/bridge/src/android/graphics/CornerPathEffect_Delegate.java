/**
 * Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.CornerPathEffect
 *
 * Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of CornerPathEffect have been
 * replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class.
 *
 * This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, keeping previously
 * native data into its own objects and mapping them to int that are sent back and forth between
 * it and the original CornerPathEffect class.
 *
 * Because this extends {@link PathEffect_Delegate}, there's no need to use a {@link DelegateManager},
 * as all the Shader classes will be added to the manager owned by {@link PathEffect_Delegate}.
 *
 * @see PathEffect_Delegate
