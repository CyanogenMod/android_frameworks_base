/**
 * Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.ColorMatrixColorFilter
 *
 * Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of ColorMatrixColorFilter have
 * been replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class.
 *
 * This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, keeping previously
 * native data into its own objects and mapping them to int that are sent back and forth between
 * it and the original ColorMatrixColorFilter class.
 *
 * Because this extends {@link ColorFilter_Delegate}, there's no need to use a
 * {@link DelegateManager}, as all the Shader classes will be added to the manager
 * owned by {@link ColorFilter_Delegate}.
