 * Read-only access to Zip archives, with minimal heap allocation.
 *
 * This is similar to the more-complete ZipFile class, but no attempt
 * has been made to make them interchangeable.  This class operates under
 * a very different set of assumptions and constraints.
 *
 * One such assumption is that if you're getting file descriptors for
 * use with this class as a child of a fork() operation, you must be on
 * a pread() to guarantee correct operation. This is because pread() can
 * atomically read at a file offset without worrying about a lock around an
 * lseek() + read() pair.

 * Open a Zip archive for reading.

 * We want "open" and "find entry by name" to be fast operations, and we
 * want to use as little memory as possible.  We memory-map the file,
 * and load a hash table with pointers to the filenames (which aren't
 * null-terminated).  The other fields are at a fixed offset from the
 * filename, so we don't need to extract those (but we do need to byte-read
 * and endian-swap them every time we want them).
 *
 * To speed comparisons when doing a lookup by name, we could make the mapping
 * "private" (copy-on-write) and null-terminate the filenames after verifying
 * the record structure.  However, this requires a private mapping of
 * every page that the Central Directory touches.  Easier to tuck a copy
 * of the string length into the hash table entry.
 *
 * NOTE: If this is used on file descriptors inherited from a fork() operation,
 * you must be on a platform that implements pread() to guarantee correctness
 * on the shared file descriptors.
