/**
 * CameraHardwareInterface.h defines the interface to the
 * camera hardware abstraction layer, used for setting and getting
 * parameters, live previewing, and taking pictures.
 *
 * It is a referenced counted interface with RefBase as its base class.
 * CameraService calls openCameraHardware() to retrieve a strong pointer to the
 * instance of this interface and may be called multiple times. The
 * following steps describe a typical sequence:
 *
 *   -# After CameraService calls openCameraHardware(), getParameters() and
 *      setParameters() are used to initialize the camera instance.
 *      CameraService calls getPreviewHeap() to establish access to the
 *      preview heap so it can be registered with SurfaceFlinger for
 *      efficient display updating while in preview mode.
 *   -# startPreview() is called.  The camera instance then periodically
 *      sends the message CAMERA_MSG_PREVIEW_FRAME (if enabled) each time
 *      a new preview frame is available.  If data callback code needs to use
 *      this memory after returning, it must copy the data.
 *
 * Prior to taking a picture, CameraService calls autofocus(). When auto
 * focusing has completed, the camera instance sends a CAMERA_MSG_FOCUS notification,
 * which informs the application whether focusing was successful. The camera instance
 * only sends this message once and it is up  to the application to call autoFocus()
 * again if refocusing is desired.
 *
 * CameraService calls takePicture() to request the camera instance take a
 * picture. At this point, if a shutter, postview, raw, and/or compressed callback
 * is desired, the corresponding message must be enabled. As with CAMERA_MSG_PREVIEW_FRAME,
 * any memory provided in a data callback must be copied if it's needed after returning.
