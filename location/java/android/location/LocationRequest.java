/**
 * A data object that contains quality of service parameters for requests
 * to the {@link LocationManager}.
 *
 * <p>LocationRequest objects are used to request a quality of service
 * for location updates from the Location Manager.
 *
 * <p>For example, if your application wants high accuracy location
 * it should create a location request with {@link #setQuality} set to
 * {@link #ACCURACY_FINE} or {@link #POWER_HIGH}, and it should set
 * {@link #setInterval} to less than one second. This would be
 * appropriate for mapping applications that are showing your location
 * in real-time.
 *
 * <p>At the other extreme, if you want negligible power
 * impact, but to still receive location updates when available, then use
 * {@link #setQuality} with {@link #POWER_NONE}. With this request your
 * application will not trigger (and therefore will not receive any
 * power blame) any location updates, but will receive locations
 * triggered by other applications. This would be appropriate for
 * applications that have no firm requirement for location, but can
 * take advantage when available.
 *
 * <p>In between these two extremes is a very common use-case, where
 * applications definitely want to receive
 * updates at a specified interval, and can receive them faster when
 * available, but still want a low power impact. These applications
 * should consider {@link #POWER_LOW} combined with a faster
 * {@link #setFastestInterval} (such as 1 minute) and a slower
 * {@link #setInterval} (such as 60 minutes). They will only be assigned
 * power blame for the interval set by {@link #setInterval}, but can
 * still receive locations triggered by other applications at a rate up
 * to {@link #setFastestInterval}. This style of request is appropriate for
 * many location aware applications, including background usage. Do be
 * careful to also throttle {@link #setFastestInterval} if you perform
 * heavy-weight work after receiving an update - such as using the network.
 *
 * <p>Activities should strongly consider removing all location
 * request when entering the background
 * (for example at {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}), or
 * at least swap the request to a larger interval and lower quality.
 * Future version of the location manager may automatically perform background
 * throttling on behalf of applications.
 *
 * <p>Applications cannot specify the exact location sources that are
 * used by Android's <em>Fusion Engine</em>. In fact, the system
 * may have multiple location sources (providers) running and may
 * fuse the results from several sources into a single Location object.
 *
 * <p>Location requests from applications with
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} and not
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} will
 * be automatically throttled to a slower interval, and the location
 * object will be obfuscated to only show a coarse level of accuracy.
 *
 * <p>All location requests are considered hints, and you may receive
 * locations that are more accurate, less accurate, and slower
 * than requested.
