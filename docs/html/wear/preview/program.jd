      Timeline and Updates
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview runs from 18 May 2016 until the
      final Android Wear public release to OEMs.
    </p>

    <p>
      At key development milestones, we'll deliver updates for your development
      and testing environment. In general you can expect updates in
      approximately 6-week intervals. The release milestones are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Milestone 1 (initial release, alpha)
      </li>

      <li>Milestone 2 (incremental update, beta)
      </li>

      <li>Milestone 3 (incremental update, beta)
      </li>

      <li>Milestone 4 (final APIs and official SDK, Play publishing)
      </li>

      <li>Near-final system image
      </li>

      <li>Final release to OEMs
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each update includes an updated support library, preview system images,
      emulator, reference documentation, and API diffs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first three milestones provide an early test and development
      environment to help you identify compatibility issues in your current
      apps and plan migration or feature work needed to target the new
      platform. This is the priority period in which to give us your feedback
      on features and APIs and file compatibility issues — for all of these,
      please use the <a href="https://g.co/wearpreviewbug">issue tracker</a>.
      You can expect some API changes across
      these updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      At milestone 4, you'll have access to the final Android Wear 2.0
      APIs and SDK to develop with, as well as near-final system images to test
      system behaviors and features. Android Wear 2.0 will use the
      Android 7.0 API level at this time.
      You can begin final compatibility testing of your
      legacy apps and refine any new code that is using the Android Wear 2.0
      APIs or features.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you test and develop on Android Wear 2.0, we strongly recommend
      keeping your development environment up-to-date as updates are released.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll notify you when updates are available via the Android Developers
      Blog, as well as via this site and the <a href=
      "http://g.co/androidweardev">Android Wear Developer Community on G+</a>.
