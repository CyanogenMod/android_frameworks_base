3. Preview License from Google

3.1 Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the Preview solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

3.2 You may not use this Preview to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this Preview is not used for that purpose.

3.3 You agree that Google or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Preview, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Preview. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

3.4 You may not use the Preview for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Preview or any part of the Preview; or (b) load any part of the Preview onto a mobile handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the Preview with other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the Preview.

3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Preview licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not the License Agreement. You agree to remain a licensee in good standing in regard to such open source software licenses under all the rights granted and to refrain from any actions that may terminate, suspend, or breach such rights.

3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the Preview that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the Preview may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Preview. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Preview (or any features within the Preview) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Preview.

4. Use of the Preview by You

4.1 Google agrees that nothing in the License Agreement gives Google any right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the Preview, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

4.2 You agree to use the Preview and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.

4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release. You agree not to publicly distribute or ship any application using this Preview as this Preview will no longer be supported after the official Android SDK is released.

5. Your Developer Credentials

5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the Preview, Google may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the Preview are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the Preview will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the Preview and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

7. Third Party Applications

7.1 If you use the Preview to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.

7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party.

8. Using Google APIs

8.1 Google APIs

8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

9. Terminating the License Agreement

14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      You can run and test your app with the Android Wear 2.0 Preview
      in either of these ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install Android Wear 2.0 on a supported watch, or
      </li>

      <li>Set up an emulator that is running Android Wear 2.0
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want an environment for basic compatibility
      testing of your app, you can use your current APK and a
      supported watch or an emulator. As described below, you don't necessarily
      need to update your full development environment to do basic testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you want to modify your app to target
      Android Wear 2.0 or use new APIs, you need to update your development
      environment. See <a href="{@docRoot}wear/preview/start.html">Get Started
      with the Preview</a>.

    <p>
      To download a preview image and flash it to the watch:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download and unzip the appropriate system image from a "Preview
      image for testing" row in a <a href="#preview_system_images">table
      above</a>.
      </li>

      <li>Attach the watch charger to the watch and plug the USB cord (from the
      charger) into your computer.
      </li>

      <li>Use the following <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html">adb
      command</a> to confirm that the watch is recognized.
      You may need to turn ADB debugging off and then on for the watch to
      be recognized:
      <code>adb devices</code>
      </li>

      <li>Use the following adb command to start the device in fastboot mode:
      <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>
      </li>

      <li>If necessary, use one of following two commands to
      unlock the device's bootloader. This step erases all data on the
      device: <code>fastboot flashing unlock</code> or, for some
      devices, <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>
      </li>

      <li>On the watch, select the option to unlock the bootloader.
      </li>

      <li>On your computer, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the
      system image in Step 1. At the top level of that directory,
      execute the <code>flash-all</code> script by typing
      <code>flash-all.sh</code> or, in the case of Windows,
      <code>flash-all.bat</code>. The following may need to
      precede the command: <code>./</code>

      After you create a virtual device as described below, follow the steps for
      <a href="#set_up_a_phone">setting up a phone</a> with the beta version of
      the Android Wear companion app.
    </p>

    <p>Create a new virtual device in Android Studio as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the AVD Manager by selecting <strong>Tools &gt; Android &gt; AVD
      Manager</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Click <strong>Create Virtual Device</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>In the <strong>Category</strong> pane, select <strong>Wear</strong>
       and choose a hardware profile.
       The Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview
       is only optimized for round devices currently, so we recommend not
       using the square or chin profiles for now.
       Click <strong>Next</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Select a <strong>Nougat</strong> image to download. The images may be on
      the <strong>x86</strong> tab instead of the <strong>Recommended</strong>
      tab, until installed. For example, select the image with the
      <strong>Release Name</strong> of Nougat, the <strong>API Level</strong> of 24,
      and the <strong>Target</strong> of "Android 7.0 (with Android Wear)".
      When the download and installation are complete, click
      <strong>Finish</strong> and then click <strong>Next</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Verify the configuration of the Android Virtual Device (AVD) and
      click <strong>Finish</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Start the emulator by selecting the new virtual device, clicking the
      <strong>Play</strong> button, and waiting until
      the emulator initializes and shows the Android Wear home screen.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Pair the phone with the emulator, and sync a Google Account, as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Follow the steps for
      <a href="#set_up_a_phone">setting up a phone</a> with the beta version of
      the Android Wear companion app.
      </li>

      <li>On the phone, enable Developer Options and USB Debugging.
      </li>

      <li>Connect the phone to your computer through USB.
      </li>

      <li>Forward the AVD's communication port to the connected handheld device
      (each time the phone is connected):<br>
      <code>adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601</code>
      </li>

      <li>On the phone, in the Android Wear app, begin the standard pairing
      process. For example, on the Welcome screen, tap the
      <strong>Set It Up</strong> button.
      Alternatively, if an existing watch already is paired, in the upper-left
      drop-down, tap <strong>Add a New Watch</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>On the phone, in the Android Wear app, tap the
      Overflow button, and then tap
      <strong>Pair with Emulator</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Tap the Settings icon.
      </li>

      <li>Under Device Settings, tap <strong>Emulator</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Tap <strong>Accounts</strong> and select a Google Account,
      and follow the steps in the wizard to
      sync the account with the emulator. If necessary, type the screen-lock
      device password, and Google Account password, to start the account sync.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can now test an app with a virtual preview device
      in the <a href=
