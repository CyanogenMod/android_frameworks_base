    <h4>
      Additions for standalone apps and the Play Store on Wear
    </h4>

    <p>
      For information about planning your Wear 2.0 app, see <a href=
      "https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/features/standalone-apps.html">
      Standalone Apps</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, the minimum and target SDK level for Wear 2.0, and for a
      standalone APK, is level 24. The minimum SDK level can be 23
      only if you are using the same APK
      for Wear 1.0 and 2.0 (and thus have an embedded Wear 1.0 APK).
    </p>

    <p>
      Run-time permissions are required.
    </p>

    <h4 id="additions-to-the-complications-api">
      Complications API additions
    </h4>

    <p>
      For Preview 3, additions and changes have been made to the Complications
      API. The <a href=
      "https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/features/complications.html">documentation</a>
      includes information about the following additions and changes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To receive complication data and open the provider chooser, a watch
      face must have the <code>RECEIVE_COMPLICATION_DATA</code> permission.
      </li>

      <li>To ease a request for the new permission and the starting of the
      chooser, the <code>ComplicationHelperActivity</code> class is available
      in the wearable support library. This class should be used instead of
      <code>ProviderChooserIntent</code> to start the chooser in almost all
      cases.
      </li>

      <li>Watch faces can specify default providers that are used until a user
      selects a provider.
      </li>

      <li>The complication types used for "empty" data are changed.
      </li>

      <li>A new permission was added to ensure that only the Android Wear
      system can bind to provider services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For changes related to the <code>ComplicationData</code> object, see

      Known Issues
    </h3>

    <h4 id="notifications">
      Notifications
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>The <code>MessagingStyle</code> <a href=
      "https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/features/notifications.html#images">
        notifications with images</a> posted by standalone apps don't show
        images in the notification (i.e., bridged notifications show images,
        but standalone notifications don't).
      </li>

      <li>This preview release does not include support for notification
      groups.
      </li>

      <li>With Wear 2.0, a watch can receive notifications directly from
      Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which replaces Google Cloud Messaging
      (GCM). However, in Preview 3 of Wear 2.0, FCM does not function with
      iOS-paired watches.
      </li>

      <li>Smart Reply responses are only shown in <code>RemoteInput</code> when
      <code>RemoteInput</code> is called from a <code>MessagingStyle</code>
      expanded notification. Smart Reply responses are not shown in
      <code>RemoteInput</code> when <code>RemoteInput</code> is called from an
      <a href=
      "https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/features/notifications.html#inline">
        inline action</a> within the stream&#8212;an action set with the <a href=

        setHintDisplayActionInline(true)</a> method.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="companion-app">
      Companion app
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>The preview companion app is not compatible with Android 4.3
      (Jelly Bean MR2), which has an SDK build version code of:
      <code>JELLY_BEAN_MR2</code></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>In permission screens in the preview companion app:
      If you deny a permission, you cannot
      proceed. Instead of denying a permission, tap <strong>Skip</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h4 id="developer-console">
      Developer Console
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>If you set a minimum SDK version of 24, the Play Developer Console
      states that there are few supported devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="system-user-interface">
      System user interface and apps
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Dismissing multiple notifications can cause an app to forcibly close.
      </li>

      <li>The "Ok Google" detection and voice transcription may not work
      reliably.
      </li>

      <li>Google Fit is not available with Preview 3.
      </li>

      <li>Syncing for embedded apps is not enabled for the preview. Therefore,
      to test an app on a device, add it to the Play Store or side-load it
      onto a watch. Some existing Wear apps, e.g. Google Maps, are only
      using the embedded apps mechanism currently, and are therefore not
      installable on the preview (and therefore do not appear on the watch).
      </li>

      <li>In Play Store search results on the watch,
      results other than apps sometimes appear.
      </li>

      <li>Media controls/notifications are not bridged
      to the watch from an Android KitKat phone.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="account">
      Account sync
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Account sync initiated from watch settings may not work reliably.
      Instead, add accounts from the setup flow of the Android Wear app, or using
      the Accounts settings for a device from the Android Wear app.
      </li>

      <li>The list of accounts that can be synced is the same as the list of accounts
      on the phone. So to add a new account, use the Android settings on the phone,
      and then proceed to Android Wear app to sync that account.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="devices">
      Devices
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>In Android Wear emulators, the Play Store app requires that an
      account is synced to the device before the app can be opened.
      </li>

      <li>On the Huawei Watch, selecting the language, followed by multiple
      acknowledgement dialogues, results in a black screen.
      </li>

      <li>On the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition, when answering a call from the
      watch, the watch does not provide audio from the caller.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="smart-reply">
      Smart Reply
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Smart Reply is only available if your watch's system language is
      English.
      </li>

      <li>Smart Reply responses are not generated for all messages.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h4 id="wearable-drawers">
  Wearable drawers
</h4>

<p>
  The following are feature additions for <a href=
  "{@docRoot}wear/preview/features/ui-nav-actions.html">
  wearable drawers</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drawer peeking is now supported in the <code>onCreate()</code> method
  of your app's activity.
  </li>

  <li>The automatic drawer peeking behavior is
  inverted. Now the bottom drawer peeks when the user scrolls down the view
  and top drawer peeks when the user scrolls to the top of the view
  (previously scrolling down did not show peek view).
  </li>

  <li>Two new attributes, <code>peek_view</code> and
  <code>drawer_content</code>, are added to
  <code>WearableDrawerView</code> to specify contents of custom drawers and
  peek view in your XML layout (previously, custom drawer contents were
  specified only through Java code).
  </li>

  <li>The Navigation drawer now displays page indicator dots.
  </li>

  <li>Peek views now close automatically after one second.
  </li>

  <li>The <code>WearableNavigationDrawer</code> now automatically closes
  after five seconds or when an item is tapped.
  </li>

  <li>There is improved drawer handling (size and margins) for devices with chins:
    <ul>
      <li>Size: The bottom drawer is slightly smaller when there is a
      chin.
      </li>
      <li>Margins: <code>WearableDrawerLayout</code> sets its bottom margin
      size equal to the size of the chin, so that the bottom drawer is
      fully visible.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>The navigation drawer contents are now updated when
        <code><a href="{@docRoot}reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html#notifyDataSetChanged()">
        notifyDataSetChanged</a></code> is called on the adapter.
  </li>

    <li>In your <code>WearableActionDrawer</code>, when there is only one
      action, its icon is shown in the peek view and the action is executed
      when the peek view is tapped.
    </li>

    <li>When the peek view of your <code>WearableActionDrawer</code> has
      more than one action, both the first action and the overflow icons are
      shown.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gestures">
  Wrist gestures
</h4>

<p>
  Wrist gestures can enable quick, one-handed interactions with your app.
  For example, a user can
  scroll through notifications with one hand while holding a cup of water
  with the other. For more information, see <a href=
  "{@docRoot}wear/preview/features/gestures.html">
  Wrist Gestures</a>.

  <li>Double pressing the power hardware button while on the launcher
  causes the watch screen to turn black.
  </li>

  <li>Dismissing multiple notifications can cause app to forcibly close.
  </li>

  <li>Turning screen lock to off (Enable and disable) functionality is not
  reliable.
  </li>

  <li>The "Ok Google" detection and voice transcription may not work
