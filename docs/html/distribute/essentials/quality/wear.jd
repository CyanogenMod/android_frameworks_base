<p>
  Android Wear aims to provide users with just the right information at just the right time. Great
  Android Wear experiences are launched automatically, glanceable, and require zero or low user
  interaction. Designing apps for wearables is substantially different than designing for phones or
  tablets. There are different strengths and weaknesses, different use cases, and different
  ergonomics to take into consideration.
</p>

<p>
  The first step toward creating a great experience for users on Wear is to read the
  <a href="{@docRoot}design/wear/index.html">Android Wear design guidelines</a>, which provides
  instructions on how to build the best user experience for Wear apps. You should also review the
  <a href="{@docRoot}training/building-wearables.html">Building Apps for Wearables</a> training, to
  understand the basic implementation requirements for a Wear app.
</p>

<p>
  This document helps you assess basic aspects of quality in your Wear app through a
  compact set of functional and user interface quality criteria.
   Make sure to check out the <a href="https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/index.html">Wear 2.0 preview</a>
  documentation to get ready for the next version of Android Wear.
</p>

<p class="caution">
  <strong>Important:</strong> To ensure a great user experience, apps for wearables must meet
  specific requirements for usability. Only apps that meet the following quality criteria will
  qualify as an Android Wear app on Google Play. Qualifying as a Wear app will make it easier for
  Android Wear users to discover your app on Google Play.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> For information about how to publish your Wear apps in Google Play, see <a
  href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/wear.html">Distributing to Android Wear</a>.

  <strong>Important:</strong> To learn about how Wear 2.0 platform changes may affect
   your apps, see the <a href="https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/index.html">Wear 2.0 preview</a>

  Frequently Asked Questions
  </h2>
</div>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">
  <strong>After I submit my app for Android Wear review, how will I find out if my app does not meet
  all the requirements for Wear?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If your app does not meet the usability requirements described on this page, the Play Store team
  will contact you through the email address specified in the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Google Play Developer Console</a> account associated with
  the app.
</p>
<p class="caution">
  <strong>Caution:</strong> Make sure your app meets the <a href="#fn">functionality
  requirements</a>, otherwise your app will not be considered a Wear app and will not be reviewed
  for Wear <a href="#ux">design and interaction</a>.
</p>
<p class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> For information about how to publish your Wear apps in Google Play, see <a
 href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/wear.html">Distributing to Android Wear</a>.
</p>


<p style="margin-top:30px;">
  <strong>If my app does not meet the Wear requirements, will my new or updated app still appear on
  Google Play for phones and tablets and still be installable on wearables?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Yes. The requirements described above only determine whether your app will be identified as an
  Android Wear app on Google Play and easier for Android Wear users to discover. If your app is not
  accepted as a Wear app, it will still be available to other device types, such as phones and
  tablets, and it will still be installable on wearables.
</p>
