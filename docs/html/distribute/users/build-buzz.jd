<p>
  With more apps published each week in Google Play, building  buzz
  around your own apps helps them get noticed and makes it easier for
  users to find and download them.
</p>

<p>
  Building buzz doesn’t have a single formula. The tools and techniques
  described here have worked for other developers, but finding the right mix
  will depend on your apps, your audience, and your competition. And don’t be
  afraid to try something different or quirky, taking a risk could pay big
  dividends.

<p>
  After publishing your apps, you can take Android users directly to your
  app/games detail page on Google Play by <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/tools/promote/linking.html">providing links</a> in your
  social network posts, ad campaigns, app reviews and articles, your website,
  and more.
</p>

<p>
  You can also link to:

  <li>A <a href=

<p>
  Cross promoting, or house ads, is a great cost effective way to get users to
  try out new titles. Be sure that your house ad is unobtrusive and presented
  at a time convenient for users to leave your apps and try out your new title.
  Also, be sure to include logic that allows users to dismiss the ad and
  control if they will be asked again later.
</p>

<p>
  Consider using free AdMob <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/admob/v2/answer/3210452?hl=en#subid=us-en-et-dac">
  house ads</a> within your apps to create awareness and promote your entire
  portfolio of apps. When launching new apps, an easy way to quickly attract
  users is to promote directly to your existing customers.

    Hold a Contest

</div>

<p>
  Contests can be a great way to engage your users. If you have a game, hold a
  tournament and promote it through your marketing channels. Use Google Play
  Games APIs for leaderboards and achievements to stimulate competition. Some
  app developers have provided prizes for creative uses of an app or social
  engagement. For example, a photo app developer can hold a photo contest.
</p>

<p>
  But be sure you’re complying with the appropriate legal requirements in your
  country and provide a clear set of terms and conditions, accessible online.
  Don’t let a lack of attention to detail spoil a great marketing opportunity.

</div>

<p>
  Public Relations outreach can be a valuable marketing initiative. Many
  developers use PR to announce new features in their apps or games, which, in
  turn, builds demand for the updated release when it comes out. You can also
  provide early copies of your app or game for the press to review, and publish
  their reviews when the app or game launches.
</p>

  <h2 id="use-social-media">
    Use Social Media

</div>

<p>
  Social media is your opportunity to build promotion for your apps. Start with
  your own channels: update users on your plans before launch, announce your
  launch, and talk about progress after launch (downloads, new features, and
  alike.) Then expand by encouraging your users to forward and share your
  posts.
</p>

<p>
  Take advantage of bloggers. Look for bloggers that cover Android and learn
  what interest them. Remember to look locally as well as globally, gaining a
  local following can be a great springboard to global success. When you’ve
  selected a target group of bloggers focus on them by sending details of your
  apps and free versions if the apps are priced. Follow up and ask them to
  review your apps. A review on the right blog is a great promotion.

<p>
  YouTube videos are now an essential part of building buzz. Use them to
  showcase your apps’ feature. Remember to do this before, at, and after
  launch. Taking users on a journey through the development of your apps can be
  a great way to drive downloads at launch.
