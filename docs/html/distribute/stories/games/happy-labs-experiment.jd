  <a class="external-link"
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5211519071117278745&hl=en">Happy Pet Story</a>,
  launched in February 2016 and is designed for female gamers of all ages.
</p>

<p>
 Following the announcement of Store Listing Experiments in May, Happy Labs decided to test
 variations of their game icon and screenshots to optimize their store listing.
</p>

<h3>What they did</h3>

<p>
 Happy Labs used the Store Listing Experiments feature in the Google Play Developer Console to
 test three new variations of their new game icon. Encouraged by early results, they then
 optimized the game screenshots displayed in their store listing.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
 The results showed that the new icon, <em>Sweet Bubbles</em> without a frame, outperformed
 the initial <em>Mojo</em> icon and two other variants, with a 38.6% increase in installs:

</p>

<p>
 Based on these findings, Happy Labs changed the Happy Pet Story icon to the new image globally
 on Google Play.
</p>

<p>
 Following the positive icon testing results, Happy Labs ran global store listing experiments
 with a combination of screenshots from their store listing over a five week period. They then took
 their best performing screenshots from the experiments and tested them across three specific
 countries: Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan. The results showed an average increase of 19.87% in
 installs.
</p>

<p>
 Migrating from the original images to the variants shown in the following figure increased organic
 installs in Thailand by 13.9%:

<p>
 With the combination of both store listing experiments, Happy Pet Story saw an average increase of
 32% in month-on-month organic daily downloads globally, as described by Jeffrey Chee, CEO of Happy
 Labs:

<p>
 <em>“Store listing experiments have been an invaluable tool for us in optimizing our Play store
 presence. I am really happy that we were able to get an uplift of 32% in organic installs with
 minimal investment in terms of resources.”</em>
