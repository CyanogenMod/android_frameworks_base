<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  As part of Juice Cubesâ€™ content update in April 2016, Playlab decided to
  refresh its Play Store icon and test whether different icons could increase
  their conversion rate.
</p>

<p>
  Playlab used the <em>Store Listing Experiments</em> feature on the Google
  Play Developer Console to test three variations of their new game icon.
</p>

<h3>
  Results
</h3>

<p>
  Within three days of running the store listing experiment, Playlab saw
  positive results which led them to make an informed decision to change the
  current icon to the best-performing version. Variant C outperformed the
  initial control icon and the two other variants, with a <strong>25% increase
  in installs</strong>. One month after applying the best-performing icon,
  Juice Cubes continued to see a 25% increase in the number of conversions
  from store visitors who made organic installs.

  <em>"Google Play Store Listing Experiments offer a fast, easy, and free way
  to do A/B testing on an icon. The data provided after each test helped us
  to make a decision really quickly. The best part is the team no longer needs
  so many resources to decide which icon to use because we can let the
  users decide."</em> said Jakob Lykkegaard, CEO and co-founder of Playlab.
