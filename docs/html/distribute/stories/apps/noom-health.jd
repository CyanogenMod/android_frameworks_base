<h3>
  Background
</h3>

<p>
  With a mission to help people live healthier lives,
  <a class="external-link" href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Noom+Inc.">Noom</a> guides
  their users through behavior change programs to create lifestyle habits and
  target global health challenges. Available initially on Google Play,
  Android first and Noom have achieved success expanding to international
  markets, taking advantage of the broad reach of Android.
</p>

<h3>
  What they did
</h3>

<p>
  Launching first in the US, Noom created a series of programs tailored to
  their users’ specific <a class="external-link" href=
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wsl.noom">
  health goals</a>. Key to their approach is offering a holistic solution,
  including simple personalized tasks, progress tracking, meal feedback, and
  support from both personal coaches and peers. The team has a strategic
  approach to expanding their user base globally. Noom localized their app to
  better connect with users in the following areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Localized product</strong>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>In addition to translating their app to five languages and their store
      listing page to 11 languages, Noom conducted extensive analysis to
      determine the right financial model tailored to each international
      market. This included evaluation of their competitive landscape and
      local health and wellness spending behavior, in addition to running
      pricing experiments to determine the optimal offering between
      subscriptions, IAPs, or a premium app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Localized cuisines</strong>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>When Noom started researching the Korean, Japanese, German, and Latin
      American markets, they immediately focused on localizing their food
      database. Using a combination of local food editors, existing food
      databases, and user suggestions, their app now includes local cuisine
      and popular packaged food brands, offering a simpler and more
      comprehensive experience for users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Localized coaches</strong>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Hiring local coaches not only removed language barriers, but also
      reduced response times as they are located within the same time zone
      as their users. Using various notification types, Noom has increased
      user engagement by three to four times.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Results
</h3>

<p>
  <em>"Android's global focus and great localization tooling made the decision
  to go global much easier. Localization to new markets has been a consistent
  growth driver at Noom,"</em> said Artem Petakov, co-founder and President
  at Noom.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last three years, Noom’s localization efforts led to an <strong>80%
  increase in international revenue growth on Android</strong>. In Japan
  alone, <strong>revenue increased more than 480%</strong> during the same
  time period. To identify future expansion opportunities, the team looks
  towards countries with strong Android penetration and install growth
  using the English product and plans to apply their localization methods to
  achieve even greater success.
