<li>Standard in-app products (one-time billing), or</li>
<li>Subscriptions, (recurring, automated billing)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you use the in-app billing service to sell an item,
whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, Google Play
handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process
any financial transactions. Google Play uses the same checkout backend service as
is used for application purchases, so your users experience a consistent and
familiar purchase flow.</p>

<p>Any application that you publish through Google Play can implement In-app Billing. No special
account or registration is required other than an Android Market publisher account and a Google
Checkout merchant account.</p>

<p>To help you integrate in-app billing into your application, the Android SDK
provides a sample application that demonstrates how to sell standard in-app
products and subscriptions from inside an app.</p>
