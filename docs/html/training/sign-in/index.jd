  Google Sign-In for Android lets you authenticate a user with the same credentials they use on 
  Google. After a user signs in with Google, you can create more engaging experiences and drive 
  usage of your app.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/">Google Android API</a> allows
  you to integrate sign-in and social features into your app.

  Sign-in</a>.

<h4>Access the profile and social graph</h4>
<p>
  After users have signed in with Google, your app can welcome them by name and display their 
  picture. If your app requests social scopes, it can connect users with friends, and access  
  age range, language, and public profile information.<br>
