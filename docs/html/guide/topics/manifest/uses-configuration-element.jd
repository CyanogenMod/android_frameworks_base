<!-- ##api level 3##  see comment below -->

<!-- the "no___" values are nonsensical if they mean "doesn't work on devices with a
keyboard / navigation control / touch screen."  Dianne says that that's what they mean and 
that they therefore should be eliminated.  Suchi says that they mean "doesn't require a 
keyboard / navigation control / touch screen to work."  But then what does "undefined" mean?
Seems like some API change is in the works, either eliminating the "no___" values or
"undefined".  Since it's unclear what the change will be, I've chosen to document the "no___" 
and "undefined" attributes using the same language, which is surely wrong but may make it
easier to update the doc when the change is made. -->

<dt>description:</dt>
<dd>Indicates what hardware and software features the application requires.  
For example, an application might specify that it requires a physical keyboard 
or a particular navigation device, like a trackball.  The specification is
used to avoid installing the application on devices where it will not work.

<p>
If an application can work with different device configurations, it 
should include separate {@code &lt;uses-configuration&gt;} declarations for 
each one.  Each declaration must be complete.  For example, if an application 
requires a five-way navigation control, a touch screen that can be operated 
with a finger, and either a standard QWERTY keyboard or a numeric 12-key
keypad like those found on most phones, it would specify these requirements
with two {@code &lt;uses-configuration&gt;} elements as follows:
</p>

<pre>&lt;uses-configuration android:reqFiveWayNav="true" android:reqTouchScreen="finger"
                    android:reqKeyboardType="qwerty" /&gt;
&lt;uses-configuration android:reqFiveWayNav="true" android:reqTouchScreen="finger"
                    android:reqKeyboardType="twelvekey" /&gt;</pre></dd>

<dt>attributes:</dt>
<dd><dl class="attr">
<dt><a name="five"></a>{@code android:reqFiveWayNav}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the application requires a five-way navigation control 
&mdash; "{@code true}" if it does, and "{@code false}" if not.  A five-way
control is one that can move the selection up, down, right, or left, and 
also provides a way of invoking the current selection.  It could be a 
D-pad (directional pad), trackball, or other device.  

<p>
If an application requires a directional control, but not a control of a
particular type, it can set this attribute to "{@code true}" and ignore 
the <code><a href="#nav">reqNavigation</a></code> attribute.  However,
if it requires a particular type of directional control, it can ignore
this attribute and set {@code reqNavigation} instead.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="hard"></a>{@code android:reqHardKeyboard}</dt>
<dd>Whether or not the application requires a hardware keyboard &mdash;
"{@code true}" if it does, and "{@code false}" if not.</dd>

<dt><a name="kbd"></a>{@code android:reqKeyboardType}</dt>
<dd>The type of keyboard the application requires, if any at all. 
This attribute does not distinguish between hardware and software 
keyboards.  If a hardware keyboard of a certain type is required,
specify the type here and also set the {@code reqHardKeyboard} attribute 
to "{@code true}".

<p>
The value must be one of the following strings:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Value</th>
   <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code undefined}"</td>
   <td>The application does not require a keyboard. 
       (A keyboard requirement is not defined.)  
       This is the default value.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code nokeys}"</td>
   <td>The application does not require a keyboard.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code qwerty}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a standard QWERTY keyboard.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code twelvekey}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a twelve-key keypad, like those on most 
       phones &mdash; with keys for the digits from {@code 0} through 
       {@code 9} plus star ({@code *}) and pound ({@code #}) keys.</td>
</tr>
</table></dd>

<dt><a name="nav"></a>{@code android:reqNavigation}</dt>
<dd>The navigation device required by the application, if any.  The value 
must be one of the following strings:

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Value</th>
   <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code undefined}"</td>
   <td>The application does not require any type of navigation control. 
       (The navigation requirement is not defined.)  
       This is the default value.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code nonav}"</td>
   <td>The application does not require a navigation control.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code dpad}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a D-pad (directional pad) for navigation.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code trackball}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a trackball for navigation.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code wheel}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a navigation wheel.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If an application requires a navigational control, but the exact type of
control doesn't matter, it can set the 
<code><a href="#five">reqFiveWayNav</a></code> attribute to "{@code true}"
rather than set this one.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="touch"></a>{@code android:reqTouchScreen}</dt>
<dd>The type of touch screen the application requires, if any at all.
The value must be one of the following strings: 

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Value</th>
   <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code undefined}"</td>
   <td>The application doesn't require a touch screen.  
       (The touch screen requirement is undefined.)
       This is the default value.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code notouch}"</td>
   <td>The application doesn't require a touch screen.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"{@code stylus}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a touch screen that's operated with a stylus.</td>

   <td>"{@code finger}"</td>
   <td>The application requires a touch screen that can be operated with a finger.</td>
