and auto-resume audio playback.</p>


<h3>Camera and Camcorder</h3>

<p>New preview API doubles the frame rate from ~10FPS to ~20FPS. Camera now supports portrait
orientation, zoom controls, access to exposure data, and a thumbnail utility. A new camcorder
profile enables apps to determine device hardware capablities.</p>


<h3>Graphics</h3>

compression.</p>


<h3>Data backup</h3>

<p>Apps can participate in data backup and restore, to ensure that users maintain their data
after performing a factory reset or when switching devices.</p>


<h3>Device policy manager</h3>

<p>New device policy management APIs allow developers to write "device administrator" applications
that can control security features on the device, such as the minimum password strength, data wipe,
and so on. Users can select the administrators that are enabled on their devices.</p>


<h3>UI framework</h3>

<p>New "car mode" and "night mode" controls and configurations allow applications to adjust their UI
for these situations. A scale gesture detector API provides improved definition of multi-touch
events. Applications can now customize the bottom strip of a TabWidget.</p>
