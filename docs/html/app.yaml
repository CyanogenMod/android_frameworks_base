# This file defines two mutually exclusiv
# hander blocks:
# - a handler for use on a local dev_appserver
#   during development or non-production doc build
# - a handler for use on a production gae
#   instance. This handler requires that the
#   docs files in the app have been compressed
#   with divide_and_compress.py and that main.py
#   and gae_shell/ are present.
#
# Only one of the handler blocks should be
# uncommented at any given time. By default,
# the development handler is exposed.
