Files in this directory are not hosted on developer.android.com.

This directory serves as a "master" repository for various
downloadable files. This provides us consistent version control
for downloadables that are associated with documentation.

Once saved here, the files must be uploaded to a separate
hosting service where they're accessible by users, such as
Google Cloud Storage.
