/**
 * This test case provides a framework in which you can test Application classes in
 * a controlled environment.  It provides basic support for the lifecycle of a
 * Application, and hooks by which you can inject various dependencies and control
 * the environment in which your Application is tested.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle Support.</b>
 * Every Application is designed to be accessed within a specific sequence of
 * method calls (see {@link android.app.Application} for more details).
 * In order to support the lifecycle of a Application, this test case will make the
 * following calls at the following times.
 *
 * <ul><li>The test case will not call onCreate() until your test calls
 * {@link #createApplication()}.  This gives you a chance
 * to set up or adjust any additional framework or test logic before
 * onCreate().</li>
 * <li>After your test completes, the test case {@link #tearDown} method is
 * automatically called, and it will stop & destroy your application by calling its
 * onDestroy() method.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Dependency Injection.</b>
 * Every Application has one inherent dependency, the {@link android.content.Context Context} in
 * which it runs.
 * This framework allows you to inject a modified, mock, or isolated replacement for this
 * dependencies, and thus perform a true unit test.
 *
 * <p>If simply run your tests as-is, your Application will be injected with a fully-functional
 * Context.
 * You can create and inject alternative types of Contexts by calling
 * {@link AndroidTestCase#setContext(Context) setContext()}.  You must do this <i>before</i> calling
 * {@link #createApplication()}.  The test framework provides a
 * number of alternatives for Context, including {@link android.test.mock.MockContext MockContext},
 * {@link android.test.RenamingDelegatingContext RenamingDelegatingContext}, and
 * {@link android.content.ContextWrapper ContextWrapper}.
