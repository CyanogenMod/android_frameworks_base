/**
 * This class provides functional testing of a single activity.  The activity under test will
 * be created using the system infrastructure (by calling InstrumentationTestCase.launchActivity())
 * and you will then be able to manipulate your Activity directly.
 *
 * <p>Other options supported by this test case include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You can run any test method on the UI thread (see {@link android.test.UiThreadTest}).</li>
 * <li>You can inject custom Intents into your Activity (see
 * {@link #setActivityIntent(Intent)}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class replaces {@link android.test.ActivityInstrumentationTestCase}, which is deprecated.
 * New tests should be written using this base class.
 *
 * <p>If you prefer an isolated unit test, see {@link android.test.ActivityUnitTestCase}.
