 * <p>A class for producing sounds that match those produced by various actions
 * taken by the media and camera APIs.  </p>
 *
 * <p>This class is recommended for use with the {@link android.hardware.camera2} API, since the
 * camera2 API does not play any sounds on its own for any capture or video recording actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>With the older {@link android.hardware.Camera} API, use this class to play an appropriate
 * camera operation sound when implementing a custom still or video recording mechanism (through the
 * Camera preview callbacks with
 * {@link android.hardware.Camera#setPreviewCallback Camera.setPreviewCallback}, or through GPU
 * processing with {@link android.hardware.Camera#setPreviewTexture Camera.setPreviewTexture}, for
 * example), or when implementing some other camera-like function in your application.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is no need to play sounds when using
 * {@link android.hardware.Camera#takePicture Camera.takePicture} or
 * {@link android.media.MediaRecorder} for still images or video, respectively,
 * as the Android framework will play the appropriate sounds when needed for
 * these calls.</p>
